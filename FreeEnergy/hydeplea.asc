       The following is a letter from Mr.  William  Hyde,  inventor  of the
       Hyde Electrostatic Generator as detailed in HYDEPTNT,  HYDEHATH  and
       HYDEOFFR on KeelyNet.  This device is claimed to be self-running and
       to output 20KW of useable electrical energy.

       The inventor has  been  impeded  in  his  attempts  to  promote  the
       manufacture of his power generation  system.  If it in fact works as
       claimed, then one of these units could furnish all  electrical power
       necessary to sustain two modern homes (10KW each).

                                   URGENT APPEAL

          APPEAL TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FOR HELP WITH GOVERNMENT AND BIG
             BUSINESS SUPPRESSIONS OF NEW EMERGING ENERGY TECHNOLOGY.

       Dear Fellow Americans,

            Let me   first   introduce   myself.    I   am  an  independent
       inventor/engineer working in advanced  energy  systems.  I have been
       very successful in creating the advanced energy systems  that all of
       us will need  if  we are to survive and prosper in the coming years.
       These energy systems  use  the  natural   forces  of  the  electric,
       magnetic, and gravitational  fields  without  the   need   for   the
       environmentally damaging fossil  fuels,  nuclear,  etc.   Some of my
       work is contained in Patent #4,897,592  Electrostatic  Energy  Field
       Power Generating Systems.

            The United  States  Department  of  Energy  and  various  large
       corporations have and  are  attempting to suppress this new emerging
       energy technology.  They  have  used   vicious   harrassment,  death
       threats, blackmail, extortion  and employ people to  file  frivolous
       lawsuits to drain off resources to stop development and manufacture.
       I have been in court for five years over every concievable frivolous
       matter one could think of.

            Unless I  recieve  help from the American people, I will not be
       able to work in this important energy  technology area, as the costs
       of fighting a cabinet level federal beauracracy and  billion  dollar
       corporations is prohibitive.  My legal cost over the last five
       years has been over $35,000.  I have lost over 30 foreign patents

       because of the  government  action.   The  politicians wonder why we
       have no economy,no jobs.

            Please help one of America's  most  talented creative inventors
       by calling or  writing President Bush and your congressman  to  stop
       this outrageous attempt   to   maintain   the  "status  quo"  gready
       monopolies that rip you off day after day.

            Please send me a short note of  your  contribution towards this
       effort with your name and address and I will place you on a mailing
       list.  People on this list will first be offered  the  stock  of the
       corporation formed to   manufacture   this   new   emerging   energy
       technology plus will recieve technical updates.

            Again, I  ask  for  your help  in  this  important  matter.   I
       personally thank all  of  you  in  advance for your  help.   I  look
       forward to hearing from you all.
                                                   Sincerely,
