       This file is  intended  to  be  included  with the .PCX image of the
       Keely Airship and both text and image  are  stored as KLYAIR1.ZIP in
       the Pictures section of KeelyNet.
       --------------------------------------------------------------------
       The Keely Airship was completed in 1893 and flown in a demonstration
       carried out for the US War Department in 1896.

       The space which  the  Airship  occupied in Keely's  laboratory  came
       within a radius of six feet square.  The Airship generated in excess
       of 1000 horsepower,  consisted  of  over  2000 pieces and weighed in
       excess of 1000 pounds.

       A small stool was placed on the unit  so  that  it faced a keyboard.
       Attached to the  keyboard were many vibratory mechanisms  and  tuned
       resonating plates.

       Mr. Keely said  that  when  the plates were polarized with "negative
       attraction" the Airship  would rise  and  float  above  the  ground.
       Keely could make  the  Airship  accelerate to any desired  speed  by
       damping out certain notes on the keyboard.

       The War Department  demonstration  took place in an open field where
       Keely brought the  Airship from zero  to  500  mph  within  seconds.
       Keely was sitting on the stool and before the keyboard.

       There was nothing to shield him from the movement of the ship yet he
       seemed to suffer  ABSOLUTELY  NO  ACCELERATION  EFFECTS!    The  War
       Department was impressed yet stated THEY COULD SEE NO USE FOR SUCH A
       COMPLEX DEVICE!
