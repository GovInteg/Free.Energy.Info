  The pictures included here were scanned from Townsend Brown's actual patent
of his saucer design, Patent # 2,949,550, dated August 16, 1960.

  They were scanned into computer form using a Handy Scanner HP-3000.  The
PCX extension is to be used with PC Paintbrush +, the WPG extension is to be
used with WordPerfect 5.1, however I believe the WPG file will be compatible
with WordPerfect 5.0 as well.

  All images were scanned and used on a CGA system using Hi-Res BW,  however
they should be perfectly accetable on an EGA or VGA system.  Actually they
will probably display with even more clarity.

  I will be posting other designs and drawing as I find them available and
have the time to scan them in.  Any questions or comments should be directed
to David Brune via e-mail on the Keely Net system.
