PRINT "This is a QBasic program which explores the resultants of combining"
PRINT "counter-propagating (bi-directional) waves in various ways, in an effort"
PRINT "to discover the methods of generating so-called 'Scalar EM' waves and"
PRINT "potentials, as described in the publications of T. E. Bearden and others."
PRINT
PRINT "Most researchers are of the opinion that the key to Scalar engineering"
PRINT "is to generate 'ZERO-VECTOR' or phase-cancelled waves, which, to an"
PRINT "orthodox electrical engineer, produces 'zero' effect since you've totally"
PRINT "nulled the waves.  Earlier books by Bearden put forth the concept that,"
PRINT "though the EM-'vector' waves are cancelled, there remains a certain non-"
PRINT "Hertzian longitudinal STRESS wave on the MEDIUM ('aether') itself. This"
PRINT "'scalar-stress' wave was supposed to be the key to the warping/bending"
PRINT "of time, space, and gravity."
PRINT
PRINT "But 'summing to zero' implies a LINEAR mixing medium; yet Bearden also"
PRINT "teaches us that normal EM wave radiation produces a 'scalar aura' residue"
PRINT "around matter 'because all matter constitutes a slight NON-LINEARITY' in"
PRINT "a local region of space-- and it is the non-linear stuff that matters."

PRINT "said to be made up of two waves 'moving together in the SAME DIRECTION'"
PRINT "but out of phase) model and toward a 'multiplied and/or summed to zero'"
PRINT "wave, with a 'Whittaker/Ziolkowski Scalar Potential' made up of harmonic"
PRINT "sets of phase-locked BI-DIRECTIONAL waves."
PRINT
PRINT "This bothered me, because anytime you aim two waves at each other (counter-"

PRINT "their starting phases relative to one another. I knew this could not be the"
