The following is the text from the QBASIC program SCW.ASC.

There are thus three files :  SCWINST.ASC - this one
                              SCW.ASC     - the QBASIC program
                              SCW.ZIP     - SCWINST.ASC & SCW.ASC combined

I modified the program to allow an exit from anywhere within as well as the
ability to repeat a screen as many times as you wish.

Rick Andersen is one of the most probing investigators into the theories of
Bearden that I've had the pleasure of coming into contact with.  His questions
have helped many of us to a better understanding.  Thanks Rick!

SCW.BAS  7/16/95 by Rick Andersen

This is a QBasic program which explores the resultants of combining counter-
propagating (bi-directional) waves in various ways, in an effort to discover
the methods of generating so-called 'Scalar EM' waves and potentials, as
described in the publications of T. E. Bearden and others.

Most researchers are of the opinion that the key to Scalar engineering is to
generate 'ZERO-VECTOR' or phase-cancelled waves, which, to an orthodox
electrical engineer, produces 'zero' effect since you've totally nulled the
waves.  Earlier books by Bearden put forth the concept that, though the EM-
'vector' waves are cancelled, there remains a certain non-Hertzian
longitudinal STRESS wave on the MEDIUM ('aether') itself.  This 'scalar-
stress' wave was supposed to be the key to the warping/bending of time, space,
and gravity.

But 'summing to zero' implies a LINEAR mixing medium; yet Bearden also teaches
us that normal EM wave radiation produces a 'scalar aura' residue around
matter 'because all matter constitutes a slight NON-LINEARITY' in a local
region of space-- and it is the non-linear stuff that matters.

The careful reader will note that, since around 1989, Tom Bearden has been
moving away from the 'sum-zero' cancelled wave (specifically said to be made
up of two waves 'moving together in the SAME DIRECTION' but out of phase)
model and toward a 'multiplied and/or summed to zero' wave, with a
'Whittaker/Ziolkowski Scalar Potential' made up of harmonic sets of phase-
locked BI-DIRECTIONAL waves.

This bothered me, because anytime you aim two waves at each other (counter-
propagating), they slide IN and OUT of phase rhythmically, regardless of their
starting phases relative to one another. I knew this could not be the 'scalar'
wave Bearden was writing about.  Plus, his diagrams of a 'WZ potential' seemed
to depict a spatially-static, soliton-like, sine-wave-shaped 'hump' in the
local spacetime-- something you can't produce by sliding (SUMMING) waves past
each other.

But what if you MULTIPLY the opposed waves, using a non-linear mixing medium
as is done in optical phase conjugate mirrors?

In this program I present animations which illustrate ways of combining waves
which apparently describes some of Bearden's Scalar waves.

A STANDING WAVE, made by SUMMING 2 counter-propagating waves in a linear
medium.  A standing wave has spatially-fixed 'node' points, and time-varying
amplitude/polarity at its antinodes.

MULTIPLYING two counter-propagating waves (mutual modulation) by mixing them
in a NON-linear medium gives a curious STATIC WAVE (of TWICE the 'spatial'
frequency of the component waves) riding on a time-varying, 'bouncing' DC
offset...  Twice the frequency because we are SQUARING the waves in the Time
Domain, which is DOUBLING them in the Frequency Domain."

Multiplying a SECOND bi-directional pair of waves, having a 90 degree
(quadrature) phase delay with respect to the first pair, and then SUMMING the
two products, (wave A x wave B) + (wave C x wave D), produces a time-varying
DC-like offset which rides up and down, without any spatial wave present at
all!    Are we 'waving time' here, independent of distance??

Is this Bearden's 'waving the potential' (mentioned in 'Fer De Lance' and
other books) which appears to be INSTANTANEOUS along the time/distance
horizontal axis?  Is this the 'wave' we need to generate and detect for a
'scalar communications system'?

If we SUBTRACT rather than ADD the two quadrature products that we made
previously, we produce a very unusual 'STATIC WAVE' of 'potential', spatially-
fixed in a wavelike manner and also UNMOVING (0 Hertz) with respect to time!
In other words, a FIXED, static DC potential which varies in amplitude and
polarity along its SPATIAL distribution only...

Is this Bearden's present concept of an Artificial Potential, in which
harmonically-related pairs of bi-directional waves combine into a spatially-
and TEMPORALLY-fixed soliton-like warp in the local potential?? (See the
diagrams of a 'fixed' sine wave in his book GRAVITO-BIOLOGY).

So, apparently, we CAN produce either a WAVING PURE POTENTIAL, or a SOLITON-
like hump in the potential in a local area, analogous to a DC STATIC CHARGE,
simply by properly combining (multiplying, phase-shifting and
ADDING/SUBTRACTING) four waves in the proper way!

Does this analysis imply that, anytime we generate a STATIC DC charge on a
metal sphere, etc., we are actually generating a set of phase-locked bi-
directional waves, traveling to and from the surrounding space?

(As Bearden describes in GRAVITO-BIOLOGY)

Does STATIC DC, then, have a 'Fourier spectrum' analysis, just as AC does?

Notice how different all of this is from Bearden's earlier phase-nulled, 180-
degree cancellation systems (also espoused by Hooper, W.B. Smith and his
'Tempic-field' Cadeucus coil, etc).

The big question is:  How do we build one of these generators?

We need a 3-dimensional non-linear space or medium in which to mix the waves
(unlike radio-type mixers/modulators, which are only 1-dimensional). Phase-
conjugate mirror technology might provide a clue.  Perhaps it has already been
done... See the book CLEAR INTENT by Timothy Good, in which it is claimed by
ufologist Bob Eschler that NASA has a secret 'antigravity room' somewhere, in
which astronauts can train in near-weightless conditions, produced by some
sort of 'fluorescent plasma' devices installed in the ceiling... Hmmm, doesn't
plasma provide a non-linear medium for the cross-modulation (multiplication)
of waves???

It is my guess that the 'waving DC potential' is what we need for a scalar
communications device, while our 'static' soliton wave will serve to bend
time/gravity/ambient charge in a fixed direction/amount depending on where you
measure along a wavelength, distance-wise.

It might be interesting to see how plant growth, for example, would be
affected if we could produce a 'static potential soliton' having a wavelength
of, say, several feet, and placing a plant every 90 degrees or so along the
length of the wave... or, put a clock or wristwatch every 90 deg. and see if
they lose synchronization.  Any ideas?  Comments?  Criticisms?  Flaws in my
presentation?  DESIGNS?  Please share them with the rest of us KeelyNetters --
It's about time we proved this Scalar business true or false once and for all!
