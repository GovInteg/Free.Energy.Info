	Here we have a new idea to generate electricity
	The forms we now have are
	Hydro    electricity is clean but the water storage dams needed
	eventually silt up and beside they usually destroy our wilderness
	that are needed by our city residents to unwind.


	  Nuclear Power has been with us for some time but has proved to
	have dangerous results and the waste storage is still a problem
	waiting to be solved.
	Solar and wind generators are not a twenty hour
	four proposition with out the costly storage devices.

	Coal based generators are only adding to our Green house
	gas problems.

	The idea here is generate electricity by means of the air
	pressure that surrounds all of us.  The method has none of the
	problems associated with those methods described above and is
	renewable as well.


	Every one of us is familiar with the concept of the chimney.  In
	this design Air is drawn from below into the chimney  and up to
	the top  where it is decomposed by Ionizing rays  and then re
	absorbed into the atmosphere.  Where air has been Ionized it
	creates a vaccum and draws more air into it.  from below.  This
	causes an air flow that could be utilized to turn a electrical
	turbine.


	In a design say with a dome of twenty metres surrounded with
	ionizing equipment  on top and a air tube of 4 metres diameter
	through the centre , a turbine  inserted in the middle would be
	subject to forces in excess of 120 tons
	 To put things into perspective that is say equal to 1 square meter of
	 water falling from height of  over 120  metres.


	Of course the whole generator would have to be constructed in such
	a way than the Ionic rays would not present a health hazard to those
	nearby, although this should not be much of a challenge.


	The atmospheric ionization on one side gives rise to enormous
	pressure on the other.

	The electrical power is extracted by air turbines
	when these two pressure areas try to normalize.


	This is a imaginative idea that needs to be looked at seriously.


	 Thanks to  identity known only as
	 the captain for this idea
	 wherever you are
