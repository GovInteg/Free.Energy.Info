	If you have ever over charged an electrolytic capacitor and then
	shorted the leads out you can see the wallop this little package
	can deliver in a short space of time.

	Some of the big ones left to themselves can build up a charge
	big enough to kill people.

	These usually carry a warning to discharge them properly before
	use.  A question  though  if there is no free energy where did
	this power come from?

	The main purpose of a capacitor is to store electrical energy
	and their beginnings can be traced back to the Leyden jar when
	the only electricity was static energy  produced by rubbing
	amber with wool

	The leyden jar was a glass jar with tin foil coating layers on
	both sides of jar

	Nicola  Tesla described capacitors as the electrical equivalent
	of dynamite.

	The capacitor can be made of many materials some of which are
	listed below.  it usually consist of two conducting plates
	sandwiched around an insulator.  The thickness and type of
	insulator and the size of the plates determines the electrical
	charge it can hold.

	Some typical materials used in construction

	Electrolytics and bipolar electrolytics use a chemical substance
	to help store the energy

	Resin  dipped electrolytics which use a tanatalum dielectric

	Polystyrene , Plastic Film Capacitors , Ceramics

	oil, oil paper, aluminium, glass

	I have seen one constructed using a book with tin foil plates
	alternately connected to each other on each page , for a tuning
	capacitor in a crystal set. The tuning was affected by putting
	pressure on the book covers and squeezing tight.

	Most of the above are hard for the experimenter to construct,
	however there is one almost anyone can make and comes in two
	variants.

	Acquire two jars nearly the same height but different in
	diameter

	Place one jar inside the another.

	Have a brass rod to both sections and then fill both jars  with
	water.  Leave the water levels down on jars so that water cannot
	flow into one another.  If you  want   to improve the
	appearance, you could make a top of cork or,plastic to hold both
	jars together  and bolt the brass rod through the top, both
	brass rods need to insulated from one another.  Use both rods as
	capacitor connections.

	The other variant  is even easier

	Get a collection of jars or bottles  fill each with water each
	jar must have a common electrical connection to each others
	water.

	Place all of them on a on metal tray and fill tray with water
	Place a connection on tray ,both wires now form the leads to
	your condensor.

	Experiment with water by adding salt to water to improve
	conductivity.  I think that we, are yet to know everything about
	water and we may be surprised what else we can do with it.

	Making a normal capacitor

	If you wish to make a normal capacitor here are some ideas how
	to achieve it.

	You will need some aluminium  foil the type sold on cardboard
	rolls The more foil used the better the charge it will store.

	You will also need some wax proof paper

	You will also need any type of polymer resin as long as it is
	 sticky.  any paint shop should be able to sell you some.

	First place a length of the wax paper down and coat with
	the resin

	Next comes a layer of tin foil.

	Then another layer of resin coated wax paper

	Then the final layer of aluminium foil.

	By the way it may be wise to have the wax paper wider than
	the tin foil.

	Roll all the layers together tightly to form  a cylinder, and
	using former core may be a good idea to wrap  layers upon.

	May sure there is way you can make electrical wiring
	connections to both foil layers  and apart  from this no other
	electrical contact is to be  made between foil layers.

	There you have it.

	The biblical capacitor

	In the Christian  Holy bible there is a description of the ark
	of the covenant  that Moses and the Jewish people built that
	some say was nothing more than one really powerful self charging
	capacitor.

	Certain instructions with the metals and silk screens seem to
	confirm it.

	There were also instructions to those that were to  carry and
	manage and look after  to the ark  which seem like  to me a
	Faraday Cage Protection scheme.

	There is also a report in the bible that one unprotected
	individual touched the ark   and was killed while trying to stop
	it from falling.

	 If you wish to check this  you can find it in the Old Testament
	book of Exodus chapter 25  verse 1  to chapter 29


	I heard a report that a American citizen had also built one but
	found it to dangerous to have around and thus dismantled it.
