This a improved version of the solar still described elsewhere
	<P> 

	This is a device that could be made as a small unit or a much
	bigger one depending on the parts you can acquire.
<P> 
	I believe most of the parts solar cell and pumps can be obtained
	from various sources
<P> 
	The metal heat exchange units could be made of small copper
	tubing  and wound around any handy cylinder for small units.
	The connections between each heater exchanger and unit could be
	plastic hosing.
<P> 
	If the unit was to be of a permanent nature
	the cooling section of connection hosing could be buried deeply in
	the  ground to enhance the cooling effect.
<P> 
	You could also use  black plastic or black metal connection hosing
	in the heat section  above ground to add additional heat from the
	enviroment to the  flowing fluid.
<P> 

	I need not describe the solar panel as there are many in
	production or you could build a simple unit with black metal,
	piping and a glass cover.
<P>

<P> 
	This unit has two basic cycles heating and cooling.
<P> 
	The Cooling Bottle Cycle.
<P> 
	It would help  the unit to operate  if kept in the shade.  At
	the top of the bottle or can is mounted a solar driven fan which
	forces incoming air down.  There should be enough space on top
	or side for adequate air to be drawn in and air slots underneath
	the coils  to help remove the built up heat.
<P> 
	Underneath this, is a series of water jets forcing water pumped
	from a collection tank below  and forced down over a heat
	exchanger.  The heat exchanger is a coil of copper tubing
	carrying a fluid which could be water.  Fan forced air and water
	is passed over the tubing and removes the heat from the tubing.
	Remaining cooling water is dripped into collection tank which is
	kept at a constant level by automatic level and then is pumped back
	to the top jets.
<P> 
	The Heating cycle is supplied by solar panels.

<P> 
	Distillation
<P> 
	The distillation unit is also made up of two parts
<P> 
	The top half contains an upper heat exchanger which will take
	heat from the water vapour and cause it to condense water
	droplets along side of walls and then  the water drips into a
	collection groove and fed  via gravity to a collection storage
	container.
<P> 
	The bottom half consist of a storage unit for the salty water
	and a heat exchanger mounted just below the top of the salty
	water.  The salty water is kept at a constant level by a supply
	reservoir and an auto level feed.  This bottom heat exchanger
	gives heat to the brine water.
<P> 
	Operation of the unit.
<P> 
	Basically there is flow of fluid from the hot and cooler
	sections transferring heat to and from  via the heat exchanger
	sections.
<P> 
	This flow is controlled by a constant speed solar operated pump
	pushing fluid through the sections.

	Fluid is fed from the cooler section into the top heat exchanger
	of the distillation container where it takes heat from the water
	vapour and condenses water droplets on the side of the walls

	The Fluid  slightly heated is then fed to a solar panel where it
	is heated further and then flows to the bottom heat exchanger to
	heat the salty water  by releasing heat from the working fluid.
	The water is heated and  water vapour rises to the top.

	The heat exchange fluid now at a lower temperature is now fed to
	the cooler unit where the remaining fluid heat is extracted and
	the cooled fluid is now fed back to the top heat exchanger of
	distillation unit to begin the cycle all over again.
