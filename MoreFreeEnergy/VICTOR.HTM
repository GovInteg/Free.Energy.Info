	Victor Schauberger and the spiral flow.
<P> 
	<P> <IMG SRC ="colorbar.gif" ALT=" color line  "><P>

If you think about it for a while ,you can I am sure you can
	think of many ways that nature uses a spiral pattern.  To the
	conical windings of sea shells ,the spiral patterns of stellar
	galaxies and even to ourselves with our RNA and DNA structures
	in our bodies.
<P> 
	 All the storms that ravage our planet from time to time are
	spiral in pattern, be they hurricanes,twisters or whirly winds
	that can be seen in rural Australia.
<P> 
	In the northern tropics  of Australia the sea takes up the
	readily available solar energy.
<P> 
	Whirling sea current starts a circular uplift of heated vapour
	and in no time a cyclone with  the full fury of powerfull forces
	coming from within to maintain the storm and then some energy
	left over to cause massive damage as well as residents of Darwin
	Australia knew when Cyclone Tracy nearly destroyed it.
<P> 
	You must be familiar with the water flow out of bath tub  down
	the drain plug  spiralling in different directions  depending on
	which part of this planet you are on.
<P> 
	You may have even emptied liquid from a bottle by shaking it to
	form a vortex and noticed it emptied quicker than if you had
	not..
<P> 
	It takes only a small amount of energy to get the vortex going
	but with the aid  of gravity the mini cyclone continues until
	the bottle is emptied.
<P> 
	An unknown American inventor built and patented a water ram pump
	from information involving the spiral flow which he claims to
	have gleamed from a visit to the Egyptian Pyramid.
<P> 
	There may yet be a truth in the old laundry detergent
	advertisement of a white tornado in a bottle admittedly a big
	one.
<P> 
	Mankind only real attempt to utilise the spiral is in weapons of
	destruction by using a rifled barrel in arms ordinance to give
	flight stability and distance accuracy.
<P> <IMG SRC ="colorbar.gif" ALT=" color line  "><P>

<P> 
	A man by the name of Victor Schauberger a pre world war one
	timber worker saw great potential in the spiral flow.
<P> 
	Victor  being a keen observer of nature in the forest often
	noticed things that others did not.
<P> 
	He often saw lights at night in the rushing streams  of his
	native Bavaria and was puzzled as to what they could be.  Until
	he reasoned that they were the rocks being in impacted with one
	another.
<P> 
	When he told others they did not believe him until he took from
	a shelf some rocks  and placed them into a bucket of tap water.
	He took the bucket and the rocks into a dark place  and
	reproduced what he had seen in the forest to astonished
	witnesses.
<P> 
	The Timber department where he was working had an economy drive
	and needed a means on how to improve  their transportation of logs
	from the forest which up to then had been carried out by teams
	of oxen.
<P> 
	Victor suggested using the forest streams to transport  the logs
	and estimated  a saving of ninety percent.
<P> 
	The engineering experts were negative and pointed out  that the
	logs they were cutting were oak and beech not know for their
	ability to float.
<P> 
	But the forester knew that on the cold Bavarian nights his idea
	would work.  Some how over coming the opposition  of the experts
	he convinced the owner to give him a chance to prove his idea.
<P> 
	He built water shutes and put in wooden slats to spiral the
	water flow in a manner similar to a rifle bore.
<P> 
	When logs  were inserted into shutes the logs spun around their
	axis  and moved like bullets without touching sides of the
	shutes.
<P> 
	The idea proved very successful.
<P> 
	During World War two Victor Schauberger was interned in a nazi
	concentration camp and was forced to work on a flying disk
	project using his ideas.  It is not known by this author if the
	project was completed or if the saucers actually flew.
<P> 
	After World War two Victor migrated to the United States on
	promises by various agencies to help him develop his ideas .
	Those promises later proved to be hollow.
<P> 
	At one time he was committed to mental institution but by the
	timely interventions of trusted friends  he  was released with
	his sanity intact.  Victor returned to Europe in 1958 and died
	soon after.
<P> 
	This man may have died but some of his ideas remain.  He
	suggested that we look at the cooling cycle and not always be
	focused on the waste heat produced from our devices.
<P> 
	The explosive force we now use to provide energy such as in the
	automotive combustion cycle, for example tends to be harmful to
	the environment, Whilst the implosion equivalent may not if it
	can be found.  We should be working with the laws of natural
	forces instead of using wasted energy to oppose them.

<P> 
	The Water tornado machine as illustrated.
<P> 
	This is a machine Victor may have constructed to generate
	electricity.  A small electric motor drives a conical center
	piece  which has a large water inlet.
<P> 
	As the device spins a centrifugal force raises the water level
	and forces the water out through two spiral arms.
<P> 
	The arms nearly reach to the outer limits of containment vessel
	and a recoil  action is produced when the water sprayed out
	comes into contact  with a wavy or rippled steel ring.
<P> 
	The water then flows back to collection area by means of
	gravity.
<P> 
	The centrifugal force in the spiral arms creates a reduction in
	pressure on bottom part and this leads to great efficiency.
<P> 
	The two arms were said to look like a wild animals harmonic
	spiral horns thick at the base and coming to a thin point at
	each end.
<P> 
	When the machine was running the generator was then switched on
	line.
<P> <IMG SRC ="colorbar.gif" ALT=" color line  "><P>

<P> 
	Clean Air Machine.
<P> 
	This another spiral device but uses the shape of an oval egg.
<P> 
	Soilt air is introduced from the side  and combined with water
	that the reduced pressure draws  from the     bottom  via a
	tube .  The spiral flow in the tube  cleans the air with water
	which flows back to the base.  Clean air then  exits from the
	top.
<P> 
	<P> <IMG SRC ="colorbar.gif" ALT=" color line  "><P>
The Wind Tornado machine with a Mega watt.
<P> 
	James Yen  working for the Amerian company Grumman Aerospace
	estimates a turbine of only six feet in diameter could give a
	mega watt where as  normally a conventional one of two hundred
	feet would be needed
<P> 
	The concrete silo as illustrated has an open top and is open to
	one side.  A electric motor could be switched on to begin the
	whirlwind and once the swirling action had begun could be
	reduced in speed or taken off line.
<P> 
	An air flow  enters from the top of the tower and the air is
	forced to whirl because of the way the tower is constructed.
	When the air flow is whirling  a reduction in air pressure is
	caused Air coming from the  bottom is drawn into the vaccum and
	in doing so drives a air turbine generator.
<P> 
	Experiments with wind tunnels seem to confirm this idea will
	perform as expected.
<P> 
	We may let get to see a spiral action in generation of our power
       needs if scientific establishment is ready to seriously look at it.
