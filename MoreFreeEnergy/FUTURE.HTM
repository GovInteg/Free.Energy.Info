<P> 
	Who can really predict the future. The only ones who really know
	are the ones living there.
<P> 
	The shiny saucers that others see.
	are they from other systems?
	or could they just be from the earths distant future.
<P> 
	Just our  future relatives checking out their ancestors.
	If we took the  time to look.
	Could we recognise their faces amongst us?.
	The discoveries they make.
	To make ours look  insignificant by comparison.
<P> 
	Maybe if we tried really hard again today
	could this  be the beginning of a new golden age
	for us  all.
<P> 
	Inventions and ideas for this age lost in the midst of time
	being discovered and used again.
<P> 
	Where others see problems I see solutions waiting to be found.
<P> 
	I don't want to fight you my earth brother
	For crumbs in the sand.
	For over that small rise lies a banquet
	Laid out waiting  for the two of us .
	with seating space enough for our unknown
	earth cousins  as well
<P>
