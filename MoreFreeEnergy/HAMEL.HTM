<p>
At this time in Canada there is man by the name of David Hamel
who claims to have been contacted by aliens
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
who showed him how to produce a flying saucer using the power of
magnetic repulsion to power this craft.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
David Hamel claims to have made a design using about $3000 dollars
of tandy one inch magnets which when
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
flew created a bright light as it ascended towards the heaven.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
At the same  time electrical equipment in the area failed to function
.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
For more information on this man I suggest you check out the Project
Magnet site on my helpful sites list.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
There you can access information about a video and book by Pierre
Sinclair describing David Hamel life story

and activities

<H3>The experiment</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The drawing is an experiment that has excited some free energy
personnel
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
although David Hamel does not claim it to be a free energy device
but a demonstration of a greater principle.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
But never the less the experiment is interesting to perform and
is cheap to do so.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Parts Needed.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
2 to 3 inch circular ceramic magnet with just over 7/8 inch hole
in the centre
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
1 tandy 1 inch  circular magnet or thereabouts
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
one steel ball bearing 7/8 inch in diagram
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
a hard surface kitchen top is excellent.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
METHOD
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Place the ball bearing on the hard surface and then place the
one inch magnet on top of the ball bearing
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
if it tilts over don't worry as when you bring the larger magnet
with your  hand towards the one inch magnet it
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
will come back up.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The magnet should be in an opposing mode that is north against
north or south against south..
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Move the larger magnet into position with your hands and hold
it one inch or so above the smaller magnet.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The smaller magnet will find it own position from then on you
will need to tilt the larger magnet with your hands
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
slightly to promote a spiral forward motion under the bigger 
magnet.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Keep the magnets far enough apart so that so do not become attached
to one another.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
with some practice you should be able to keep the ball bearing and magnet spinning
for several minutes.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The Jnaudin web site on the helpful page listing may still allow
you to download an AVI film of these things in operation.

<h2>POWER FROM A  44  GALLON DRUM</h2>

<p>
<center>
 <IMG SRC ="drum44.gif" ALT=" hamel 44 gallon drum diagram "><A\>
</center>
<p>
<p> The above is a diagram of the first  machine David Hamel claims to have built.

It consisted of three levels of cone  disks with a ring of Tandy or radio shack magnets arranged in a circular pattern around the outer
rim of each cone.
<p>
On the inner side of a forty four gallon or 200 litre drum there are also arranged another set of  three circular magnet arrays  and when 
then center cones are added   to the center of the drum  ,each magnet array is in opposition to those on the opposite disk.
<p>
Thats is to say all magnets are arranged  so that north faces north   or south faces south poles.
<p>
I have heard lately that David Hamel added some water to the cones to help in achieving a good balance  with each cone when he built
his first unit.
<p>
All cones fitted inside each other. and the top cone is held in placed by an opposing magnet when the lid of the forty four gallon drum
is placed on top of said drum and held in place.
<p>
The drum is said to have been about two foot across   and further units of eight feet diameter were also claimed to have been built.
