	<P> Tate Ambient Power Module.
	Joseph Tate
	Last Known Address 760 Waldo Point
	Sausalito Ca (4965) 415 331 8150  332 9918

	U.S. Patent 4,628,299
<P> 
	This design converts radio frequency energy to power that can be
	usefully applied in power devices such as clocks,radios and
	smoke detectors.
<P> 
	This design makes use of a doubler, splitter and rectifier.
<P> 
	The device has been known to give 36 volt/9 watts.
<P> 
	This devices does away for the need for batteries by extracting
	energy from natural and man made radio waves.
<P> 
	THe device uses a coil made of the following design 479 turns of
	#22 wire on a 3" plastic tube, the coil should be loosely wound
	as  a close wound coil tends to reduce power collection.  One
	end should be connected to unit at antenna connection point and
	the other to an antenna of your choice .
<P> 
	Other coil types could be used in  your experiments  such as
	sliding induction coils  that is  inside one another  and find
	the best position by moving them in different positions.
<P> 
	Other coil types can be found by referencing any good book on
	radio fundamentals.  Check out the Telsa type coils as well.
<P> 

	Power could be also enhanced by placing a tin foil pyramid under
	the coil as this seems to also improve power.
<P> 
	The power produced also seems to improve near bridges,ships and
	any thing containing  a great deal of metal.
<P> 
	A high antenna wire seems to improve the running of unit
	although a 7 foot whip antenna worked reasonably well too.
<P> 
	A interesting side line is the inventor claims to be able to
	detect earthquakes by the rise and fall of energy levels.
