	The floating iron bar.

	I came across this  in an  experimenters book.  Not really an
	energy device but interesting  and  maybe it will teach
	something to us  about magnetic fields.

	Just the same I am assuming that readers are familiar with the
	notion of two magnets with the same poles facing each other,
	tend to repel each other.

	This device is interesting  in that claims  it will repel and
	levitate an iron  bar.  I think it was originally  made as a
	magic  trick.  to construct this device  you will need the
	following

	two metal  bars of the same size   [cobalt steel prefered as it
	can be magnetised more strongly than others.

	A bar magnet of the same size and length

	a hollow wooden box.

	Construction

	Mount a metal bar in the inside of a wooden  box

	Just above it on the top of  box  fix  the magnet  into position
	so that it will not move

	Around the magnet place some guides so that the other cobalt
	metal bar can float upwards but not sideways.

	The floating bar is actually supported by the lines of the
	magnet force  repelling similar magnetic poles

	I made something similar by accident when working on a small 12
	dc motor windscreen wiper motor with permanent magnet field
	poles.  [curved ceramic magnets]
	<P>
  
	Experiment.

	First remove the armature and take all wire winding off it.
	Remove the circular laminated armature core sections one by one.
	
	Make a new shaft out brass rod,  aluminium may work as well,
	as long as it not influenced by a magnetic field.

	Fit all laminated core pieces back onto the brass shaft.  They
	do not need to be secured tight except that  they cannot drop
	off the bottom.  They should be close together and the former
	wiring winding slots  can be  in any position.

	Keep  one laminate core  piece apart one.

	The two curved magnets from stator are placed round the sides of
	armature  core and moved so that magnetic gaps on both sides are
	the same.

	The top laminated core piece should be level with top of curved
	magnets  when placed upright with the shaft  facing upwards

	Four inches of the  shaft should be  above the magnets top most
	position when  rested  flat.

	This part of the shaft should be a smaller  diameter to allow
	easy movement of the remaining laminate piece up and down.  or
	you can drill out the centre of laminated piece to the correct
	diameter.

	The bottom of the shaft  should not protruded pass bottom magnet
	level, so the two magnet curved bottoms can rest flat on the
	base.

	Slide the last remaining laminated armature piece on to the top
	of shaft carefully and watch it float in the air held in place
	by the shaft.

	Henry A. Rowland a noted American physicist of the 1940's made
	the unusual discovery that a moving  electrostatic charged
	object influences a magentic compass.

	The experiment here consists of a disk of hard rubber or an old
	phonograph record connected to shaft of an electric motor.

	The disk is given an electrostatic charge by rubbing it with a
	piece of woolen cloth.  The disk is then spun and a magnetic
	compass is bought in close to the spinning disk.  The compass is
	deflected and the faster the spin the greater the deflection.

	It appears that a magnetic field is not only set up by  a
	current moving through a wire but by a moving electrostatic
	field as well.

	If static electricity can produce a magnetic  field  can it also
	be repelled by one .

	Can this magnetic field be used to generate a flowing electric
	current
