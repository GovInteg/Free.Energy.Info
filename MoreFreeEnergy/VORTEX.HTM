A device using high pressure  air to create to both heat  and cool

If you take a normal air compressor air outlet  nozzle and hold it between you fingers and try 
to restrict the air flow you will notice the pressurised air become hot and you will not be able to 
stand to hold it for long.	

In this device air is forced through the centre potion of this gun and air flow  is restricted  in one end by
adjustable screw at one end producing extreme heat  whilst at the other end  cool air is produced.

The placement of the air flow in the centre is critical and some practice and experimentation may be needed to get this device to work.

This device has been incorporated in air conditioning system but found not to be efficient compared to other
methods at present. An interesting device never the less
