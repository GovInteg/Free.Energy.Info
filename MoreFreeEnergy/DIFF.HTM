	Here is an extract of  a factual story that appeared in the late
	nineteen century or early twenty century
<P> 
	A man today has been arrested for trying trick people into
	investing in a phoney device.  A device he says is able to
	convey the human voice over any distance via metal wire so that
	it can be understood at the other end.
<P> 
	This con man calls the device a  telephone  which is meant to
	convey a similarity to the  word telegraph and capture the
	victim confidence because of the  wide  use of  the telegraph
	today.
<P> 
	Well informed people who are familiar with the operation of the
	telegraph  know that is impossible to send a persons voice over
	wire.
<P> 
	AND ANOTHER
<P> <IMG SRC ="colorbar.gif" ALT=" color line  "><P>

	is the real inventor of the refrigeration process  largely
	ignored and thrown into prison and the multi nationals swooped
	when the patents ran out.
<P> 
	HERE WE  GO AGAIN
<P> 
	 If God had meant men to fly he would have given them wings
<P> 
	 Up to two years after the Wright Brothers had made their first
	 historial powered flight at Kitty Hawk there were still people
	 who had trouble in believing that it was possible and that it
	 had happened despite all the newspaper reports.
<P> 
	Another virtual unknown
<P>
<P> <IMG SRC ="colorbar.gif" ALT=" color line  "><P>
 
	Nicola Tesla who did so much to bring about the twenty century
	which he virtually invented himself  with the credit usually
	going to others.
<P> 
	He is the man we have to thank for the wide use of alternating
	current in polyphase motors,  fluoro lighting, radio etc.
<P> 
	Even then he had a fight on his hands with Edison   who wanted
	the use the far inferior  Direct current method of energy
	transfer.
<P> 
	Without his gift of royalties to George Westinghouse, we would
	today be struck with a DC power station  every quarter of  mile
	for our power needs.
<P> 
	Though out history there have been many people  who  have
	contributed to society the things that we now enjoy, and who
	were  then accused of fraud or deceit and later to have their
	ideas proven and  stolen from them.
<P>

             To the persons who are reading  this, you can make a difference,
	maybe not in financial support, but by  keeping an open mind on
	every thing  presented to you, offer help to people trying to
	make a difference, try to understand and don't always take the
	word of the experts as  the final say without question.
<P> 
	Make up your own mind based on the  information available to you
	and if you can't get any material then actively seek it.
<P> 
	The world today is in such a mess, every where Pollution, energy
	shortages, food shortages,corrupt people in positions of power
<P> 
	Powerful self interested groups looking out for number one
	whether it is good for anyone else's interest  or not.
<P> 
	The list of what's wrong grows daily.
<P> 
<P> <IMG SRC ="colorbar.gif" ALT=" color line  "><P>

	The world today needs all the help it can get  today.  The
	Goverments won't change  it, the multi nationals won't  really
	help either.
<P> 
	The only one's  that  can are groups  of individuals  and others
	like you, all over the world really caring and moved to action
	and support for each other
	any where on this planet we call our  home  !!! EARTH !!!

	<P> 
Don't keep forever on the public road, going only where
	others have gone.  Leave the beaten track occasionally  and dive
	into the woods.  You will be certain to find something you have
	never seen before.
