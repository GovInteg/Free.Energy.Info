	This device called the magnetromapparata was invented in 1933. It
	needed no outside power sources to function.

	 Since an official interest was noted from the heads of the
	German navy at the time  who felt an investigation was necessary
	and an official report was produced.

	Experts examined the device and could find no fraud.  It was
	judged Coler was an honest experimenter but no expert opinion was
	forth coming to how the unit operated.

             The device consisted of permanent magnets of steel ,copper coils
	and capacitors in a special holding arrangement.

	The device incorporated  six steel magnets  in a  six sided
	arrangement where the magnets were connected in series with the
	coils of about .33 ohm resistance  to form part of the circuit.
	That is a conducting path was made through the magnet core.

	The design also incorporated two small capacitors, a switch and
	a pair of sliding solenoid coils , one fitting inside the other.
	as shown in illustration.

	To allow the device to power up the following was done.

	 The switch was left open.  The magnet and coil  combination
	were moved slightly apart using a mechanical arrangement of
	cranks and sliders that  allowed each magno coil combination to
	be altered equally, There was  a wait of several minutes between
	changes.  The sliding coils were also set to different positions
	relative to one another.

	These changes were made often until a precise point was reach as
	indicated on the voltmeter.  The switch was then closed. There
	were still more changes more slowly this time until the best
	result was achieved.

	Several tests gave the 450 millivolt for period of some hours
	other times 60 millivolts  was all they could get.

	The best voltage obtained was about 12 volts and remained there
	indefinitely until the unit was shut down.

	I believe that this device has some similarities
	to the Hendershot design.

	Coler was also said to have created a device called the
	stromerzeuger.

	This consisted of a arrangement of steel magnets, flat coils and
	copper plates on open arms mounted in a parallel combination with
	one another and fed power from  a tranformer from the centre..

	The output is said to have lit a blank of lights of which the
	output exceeded the input power level.

	He was said to have built a 10 watt unit in 1925 and a 70 watt
	unit in 1933.

	Other units followed until the end of the war where work seems
	to have come to halt.
