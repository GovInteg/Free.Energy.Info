<H2>Wimshurst electro static machine.</H2>
</center>
<P>
An interesting device built late last century and early this century
was the device called the Wimhurst electrostatic machine and may
yet  hold  the key to some free energy secrets..
<P>
Unfortunately not many are built these days largely superseded
by the Van de Graf  machine.
<P>
But due to the work carried out by the Swiss  group building the
testatika  it may be worth investigating this  machine again for
yourself.
<P>
This machine is  basically  twin  disks rotating at a slow speed
in contra rotating  direction  realtive to each disk.
<P>
The disk can be hand driven or machine driven.
<P>
I used old gramophone records to build my version.
<H4>What it consist of</H4>

<P>
Two contra rotating disks  with foil sections
<P>
At the  centre middle horizontal position   two brushes positioned
at front and two at rear to collect and transfer a charge to storage
Leyden jars and then  hold it or discharge it through a spark
gap when sufficient charge has been collected from spinning disks.
<P>
A common  line  connection is shared by two of the other brushes
 C and D  to equal the charge on the both sector plates under
these brushes  at  the same time .
<P>
The same happens on disk two but with a common line connection
at a 90 degree angle  to the front common line connection.  E
 F
<P>
Power from position  A is fed to the inside metal plate of the
Leyden jar  and   from position B to the other storage capacitor.
<P>
There also a common  line connection to the outer metal plates
of both Leyden jars. 
<H4>Construction  tips</H4>

<P>
Obtain two  old gramophone records approx 30 cm in diameter  
(smaller ones can be used or a different material could be used.)
<P>
Mark each record into 36 equal segments by drawing lines across
the diameter  in ten degree segments.
<P>
Mark two circles on each record  about  one inch from the outer
 edge.
<P>
the inner circle is dependant on the foil size segments you use
and then use these for guides for placement of the metal plates.
<P>
 Most designs for this machine suggest using  al foil but I found
by getting some linotype used aluminium plates and it is
<P>
easy to cut with  scizzors and you probably get some used sheets
from a printer for about 60 cents each and two sheets
<P>
are  all you need.  I find also it  lasts a lot longer than normal
al foil..
<P>
The cut aluminium foil  must be able to fit into one of the drawn
segments on the disk and can be glued into place by any good contact
adhesive.
<P>
The sectors I used were approx 8cm in length with   one end  1cm
wide tapering out to 2.6cm with all corners rounded
<P>
you will need eighteen for each record a total of 36 cut sections.
<P>
Place one in sector leave the next one blank and then repeat 
<P>
Glue these metal leaves  into position and let them set for a
couple of weeks or longer depending on your climate.
<P>
Make sure all aluminium leaves are flat and no metal  sectors
plates are sticking up 
<P>
Later a couple layers of vanish around the plates and onto  the
record surface will also be needed as well.
<P>
On the back of one disk also attach a fibre washer to stop the
records for touching one another when in construction and working
position.
<P>
You will also  need to make  and glue pulleys to centre of each
disk
<P>
When the unit is put together these records will be mounted on
two separate shafts and be placed back to back
<P>
with metal sections place on the outside.
<H4>Making your Pulleys</H4>

<P>
I have heard people have used cotton reels  but I prefer to make
them out of perspex disks cut  with a normal
<P>
home drill attachment that cuts holes from 3/4inch to about 2
1/2 inch in diameter.
<P>
The drill feed screw should be no more than 1/4 inch  and  the
bored  hole can later be drilled out to 5/16 of  an inch
<P>
(this will fit in on the threaded shaft mounted on the perspex
supports)
<P>
Cut four large diameter  disk  and two smaller ones   and  glue
them together using a nut and bolt in the drill hole
<P>
to hold the three pieces together to form a pulley.
<P>
You may need to smooth off the rough edges  on the  small disks
thus created before glueing together. 
<P>
 I used a lathe but you may get away with using   the perspex
disk  mounted on a drill chuck with  a 1/4 inch bolt and sandpapered
( be careful not injure yourself by doing this )
<H4>The drive Pulleys</H4>

<P>
You will also need to make  two more set of pulleys for your drive
wheel section
<P>
If you intend to hand drive this you will need to make these pulleys
of a larger diameter
<P>
to insure a higher gear ratio to enable the records to  rotate
at higher speed than hand cranking.
<P>
something like ration  3:1  or 2:1 is possible.
<P>
When these are mounted one  pulley must be fixed in position by
tightening nuts around both sides of pulley  on threaded shaft
<P>
( 5/16 threaded shaft is okay 1/4 is too thin and bends)
<P>
The second drive pulley needs to be able to rotate freely.
<P>
Connect  drive belt as below with drive wheels at right angles
to the disks
<P>
(These belt driving design for this set up had me puzzled for
months  and I using an inefficient cross belt in my
<P>
set up before someone sent me this idea.)
<P>
<CENTER> <IMG SRC ="wim4.gif" ALT="Pulley diagram"></center>
<H4>Making the brushes</H4>

<P>
you will need to make eight collecting brushes   for this  unit
<H4>Centre Brushes</H4>

<P>
These will be mounted at positions A and B   on perspex mounting
 at  the centre diameter edges mid point horizontal to each disk
 and they will also be a common position  on  the rear disk
<H4>Diametrical Connections</H4>
<P><center>
<A\><IMG SRC ="wimdia.gif" ALT="wiring diagram "><A\>
<H4>Basic wiring connections</H4></center>
<P>
A further two common connected  brushes are needed  at position
 C and D  (C may need to set higher and D lower than those shown
on the drawing.( blue line)
<P>
Brushes E and F shown in white on the drawing  are the from the
back of the drawing and will need to mounted
<P>
at  a position of 90 degrees to that of  C and D on the front.(white
line)
<P>
some people have used foil to make the sliding contacts with the
foil on the disk for their brushes but I  find   that
<P>
ordinary small springs mounted on small bolts via the thread make
excellent brushes  I then can bolt and tighten
<P>
them into position using nuts to adjust their positions relative
to metal sections on the records.

<P><center>
<A\><IMG SRC ="wim5.gif" ALT= "Leyden Jar "><A\>
<H4>Basic Leyden jar construction</H4></center>
<P>
<P>
I find this simple to construct using the same linotype aluminium
as used for the leaves on the disks.
<P>
I always had trouble with the wrapping foil as sold in the shops
and find the above easier to handle.
<P>
I used normal preserving jars of about 17 cm in height and 8cm
in diameter. but any thick glass type
<P>
with straight edges may  do also.
<P>
Cut  the metal  so that it will go around the outside of the jar
and overlap slightly and leave one inch gap at top and bottom
<P>
with glass exposed at each end.
<P>
Wrap the aluminium  around the outside of jar and hold in position
with tightly wound insulating tape and then apply some
<P>
contact adhesive and let it  flow between the metal and the  glass.
<P>
Apply some self adhesive clear plastic sheeting and cover both
the metal and the glass.
<P>
For the inside of the jar  cut metal the same height but smaller
than outside length and form into cylinder  using another  glass
jar of  the same diameter and then slip inside  of the Jar.
<P>
It may pay to have an electrical insulated wire connection to
the metal  before you do this however. 
<P>
Your Leyden Capacitor jar is now completed.
<P>
You will need to make another one of similar dimension  try to
keep all the  measurements the same.

<H3>Putting it together</H3>
I hope from what I have written you are able to put a Wimhurst
electrostatic generator  together   and see it working for yourself
.If you construct a unit  one let me know at the email address below
