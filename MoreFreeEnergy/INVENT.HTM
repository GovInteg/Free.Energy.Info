              This by no means a comprehensive list  I'm  sure
	there are others,   if you need some publicity via this forum let me
	know  I'll add you to the list in next edition.

	 Dennis Lee of Conserve Financial services
                <P>
	Led a team  of inventors  in 1987  and claimed that have they  had
	solved the energy needs  of the planet he claims that by using what he
	terms  the use of refrigeration and low temperature phase change as
	  well as the use vacuums and high pressure  and gases other than those
	provided by water. he was able to generate electricity from heat that
	is available  from the enviroment  even in a blizzard. or in a cold
	room.  150 page  book and   three video tapes (american video standard
	)  for US Dollars  $59.95 security desposit will be returned if not
	satisfied on return of purchase.  Better World Technology P.O Box 653
	McAfee NJ 07428, U.S.  suggest you write to confirm the price and
	    availability
            Please note

	Lester J Hendershot
              <P>
	Inventor of electronic toys  and biggest claim that he could extract
	electrical energy from the environment by the use of mutli wound coils
	around a condenser wrapped around stain less steel cylinder.  Several
	threats were  made against his life Survived by his son who now
	continues his father work.
	Mark Hendershot has put together an information packet about his
	fathers work and sells it for U.S. $64.95 to help with the work

	Bruce De Palma
             <P>
	Trying to find a way to generate over unity power  with what amounts to
	an idea by Nicola Tesla by rotating  magnet and cylinder together
	biggest problem at present seems to be how to collect the electrical
	energy. Calls his device A Closed path Homopolar Machine.

	John Bedini
               <P>
	G Field device seems to be a twelve volt battery   ,a
	controller/switcher  and a twelve volt motor driving a generator
	causing it output to be transferred back to the battery.  Secret may be
	in the frequency of operation of the switcher controlling both the
	motor and  generator in sequence  that is one off   one on.  Further
	information available from Bedini Electronics Inc last known address

	Nicola Tesla
<P>
	Perhaps the greatest electrical engineer and inventor this century has
	seen even surpassing Edison Gave us numerous inventions ranging from
	water fountains to the three phrase power system and induction motors.
	Astounding achievement for his time was the construction of two A.C.
	Generator  plants at Niagara Falls in 1895 which produced eleven mega
	watts.  Believed  he could transmit electrical energy anywhere in the
	world with the need of wire but ran out of financial support before he
	could make his dream a reality.  His laboratory mysteriously caught
	fire and was immediately  offered financial help from the money men of
	his day if he would work for them. Nicola Tesla refused.  On his death
	his abode was raided by the American Government agencies and his
	belongings seized Unusual for any person unless there was something to
	hide.

<P>
	Bavarian  inventor who sought answers from nature in the particular
	the spiral
	Felt that present sciences concentrated on the destructive side of
	nature to produce energy and felt we should be working with nature
	using the non destructive side of.(implosion rather than explosive.)
