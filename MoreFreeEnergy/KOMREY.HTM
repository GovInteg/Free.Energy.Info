<P> 
	This invention  relates to an electical generator
<P> 
	With the aid of two bar shaped rotatable  arms acting as the
	armature.
<P> 
	This armature carries  a  winding  of two series  connected
	coils resulting in all outer armature poles being of the same
	[all north or all south ]
<P> 
	The stator  is made up of a yoke shaped laminated electro
	magnets positioned on the bottom and top.

<P> 
	The inventor in his patent application  claims the following
<P> 
	<P> <IMG SRC ="colorbar.gif" ALT=" color line  "><P>

<P> 
	An electrical generator comprising of a fixed stator and a rotor
	coaxial with said stator,drive means for rotating said rotor
	about its axis,said stator being provided with a pair of
	elongated bar magnets extending parallel to said axis on
	opposite sides thereof and terminating in transverse
	extremities,oppositely poled extremities of said magnets
	confronting  each other and defining magnet means having two
	axially spaced pole pairs disposed in a common axial plane and
	forming a pair of diametrically extending air gaps for
	establishing a magnetic flux path including two axially spaced
	parallel magnetic fields across said air gaps traversing said
	axis substantially at right angles,said rotor being provided
	with two axially spaced parallel elongated ferromagnetic
	elements slightly shorter than the space of said confronting
	extremities and extending perpendicularly to said axis at
	locations coplanar with said pole pairs for concurrent periodic
	aligament of said elements with said fields in said air gaps
	upon rotation of said rotor,and an output circuit on said rotor
	including winding means on each of said elements and collector
	means in series with said winding means,each of said pole pairs
	and the corresponding elements having confronting arcuate faces
	centre on said axis, the sum of the arcs spanned by said faces
	being substantially  equal to 90 degrees in plane of rotation.
<P> 
	end of claim
