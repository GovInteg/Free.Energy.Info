<H1>The David Hamel update </H1></center>
<p>
In follow up to  my first page on David Hamel  I am pleased to present additional information on his magnetic devices.
<center>
<IMG SRC="hamelg.gif"></center>
<hr><p>
This three grear design is from David Hamel!  It is his design! .
The magnets are suppossed to be around the circumference of the gears.  It is not show 
in this pic. A contact of mine is at present is constructing this device and when I hear more I  will add his progress to this page.
<p><hr>

There is a lot of speculation that ancient Egypt may have had access to technology unknown at present to us.
If you look closely at the above picture you may see a connection to the device below.
<p>
David claims  aliens  told him  all along that they had contact with ancient cultures.
It is interesting to see the arms of the people in a pushing position but seemingly not touching anything.
<p>
Look at the eyes on each person as they seem indicate a level position and balance.
On the whole the entire picture seems to indicate balance to me.
<p>
The knees of each person are bent indicating to me  energy ready to spring upwards but held down.
The hands on the ank seems to pushing upwards but if you look closely you see the weight finely
balanced on a small middle section  of the  picture centre..
<p>
Notice too the dome top  but there is a gap between the top and the weight.
<p>
Wonder why they choose an oval type drawing here and not something man made with straight lines a triangle or a square.
(interesting a magnetic field  is decribed in science as on circular oval shape.
Interesting too also to  see three sets of figures on either side of the dome and those also pushing against something unseen also.
Notice also a wooden disk at the bottom seemingly floating above the bottom of the drawing in the white gap space
<p>
Using two human like  figures  make be also mean two parts of the same things  there appear to be the same  but on closer examination 
 each is wearing a different head dress.They could also be be a male and female   ( probably making a wild assumption here but what about representation of North and South )
<p>
The two figures seem to be sitting on something either like  aladdin type lamps   maybe to indicate light  or perhaps they look like
birds   possibly indicating flight.
Or they could also be Egyptian rafts   seemingly to indicate movement.

I am usure what the wavy lines on each side represent maybe  they indicate magnetic waves  or water type ripples etc.

<p>
There may be many other unseen forces you can  feel an invisible  push against but there only one that I can think of  and that 
is magnetism in a replusion field.
<p>

<p>

All parts of this design  appear to have the  magnetic forces  in a repulsive mode and in balance overall
The device is seems  able to rotate and tilt in any direction.
The base seems to have magnets in an attraction arrangement as  displayed in the diagrams below.
<p>

<hr><p>
Hard to  so say what these two diagrams   but assume   one plate sits on another with four rotating balls  at the corners
help to keep the two magnet arrays apart. expectecting more details on this shortly
assuming the drawing are correct this would mean the magnets here are in an attraction arrangement..

Diagrams showing the  tilting rotation  of the three magnetic cores in relationship to one another.
<p><hr>
<center><IMG SRC="hamelf.gif"></center>
<p><hr>
Don't have much information on these yet but I assume  they are two parts in a repulsion or attraction mode balanced  on either a non ferris
ball   maybe granite as David has indicated in his book the Granite man and the butterfly.
