In the late 19 th century  and early 20 th  century there was performed a nearly 
forgotten experiment that generated static electricity. by lord Kelvin
<P>
This a modified form that will give better results.
<P>
The frame work is made of PVC tubing  that holds 4 x 1.5kg empty coffee tin cans or anything
made of metal.
<P>
The top of the upper two tins will contain small plastic micro garden sprinklers popularly used  and very cheap.
<P>
Both of the  bottoms of the uppermost  cans have  about a two inch centre  hole to allow water to drip into can below..
<P>
The two bottom cans have there tops completely removed and small holes punched in the bottom of each can to allow water to drip into a common collection tray.
<P>

Water is pumped through the plastic tube from the collection tray via a small car windscreen water pump and sent to the two sprinklers mounted in the lids  and then the water drips through the can until it reaches the collection tray.
<P>
distance between top and bottom can should be such that water drips and is not a continuous flow.

<P>
Wire leads are connected to di-anglar cans and then to  a spark gap terminal
<P>
When water is flowing  a spark should be generated every  twenty seconds   experimentation will be needed
to adjust the spark gap for better results.
