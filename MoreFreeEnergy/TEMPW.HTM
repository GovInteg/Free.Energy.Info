In 1975 Wally Minto donated a design to the world. His unpatented
wheel worked on a change of temperature as low as 3.5 degrees.
Apparently if you handy with a welder you can build one too. You
will need a selection of gasproof tanks of the same size and then
weld them into a wheel shape. Each tank opposing each other should
have a hollow tube connecting them together. Each tank should
also have a low boiling point gas in them as well. Arrange on
a axle so that only one or two tanks will me immersed in heated
water (solar Perhaps) Operation The bottom gas tank is immersed
in a tough of water solar heated or otherwise. The gas in the
bottom is heated and the gas becomes lighter and flows to opposite
tank where it cools down where it becomes heavier again. The heavier
gas tank is then drawn down by gravity and the process begins
again. The temp wheel rotates at slow speed but has high torque
so step up gearing may give a higher speed output

For  winter  operation, a large heat collector buried under ground
will supply the 3 and 1/2 degrees required to make it work during
the winter.

In fact a bigger heat collector buried for winter use would be
better along with a summer collector.

      This Minto's motor will generate lots of power. If you need
water or electricity this is the unit that could supply it.
