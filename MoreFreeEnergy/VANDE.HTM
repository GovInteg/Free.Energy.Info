	The Van De Graff   electro static generator
<P>
             In many physics and atomic experiments carried out today in the
	big labs there was found to be a need for good reliable high
	voltage static generator.  Since world war 2  this need has been
	met by a device call the Van De Graff It  main components
	consist of  a  metal dome ,an insulated top pulley  ,to which a
	rubber belt revolves and on this belt is a metal comb which
	carries  a charge to the metal dome.
<P>
	A support collar  insulated from the drive wheel and motor ,
	most units I have seen are made from P.V.C.tubing Inside the
	collar a rubber belt is revolved at a reasonable speed by the
	drive motor in bigger units  the belt may be enclosed in  gas
	tight container for higher voltages.
<P>
	As close as possible to the bottom of belt another metal comb is
	rested upon the belt.  When the belt is rotated a charge is
	carried from the bottom plate to the dome via the top metal
	plate.  After the belt is rotated for some time a charge will
	build up on the top dome ,care should be exercised when
	discharging,  as a nasty shock could result.
<P>
	Shown in illustration is simple  machine  which could be built
	from a tin can ,gum rubber band, and brass combs made from
	suitable brass sheets ,pvc piping and a suitable drive motor..
<P>
	To see if a charge  is building up on the tin can (dome) place a
	thread of cotton on top and if it levitates your machine has
	worked.
<P>
	A good party trick is to fully insulate a party guest
	from the ground  [preferably a female with long hair] and
	then get her to touch  the dome, her hair should stand on end.
	Make sure you discharge unit before party guest makes contact
	with the ground again.
