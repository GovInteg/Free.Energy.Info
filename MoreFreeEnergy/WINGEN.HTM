	This is a version that  uses a [S] shaped rotor, a configuration
	I have not seen before.  Using a S shaped rotor and a belt
	driven generator results in speed to low for normal electrical
	generation.  This is different in the sense that it uses no belt
	drive.  The materials are Aluminium Sheeting which can be
	obtaining from newspaper printers as they cannot reuse it again
	and it could cost as little as 60 cents a sheet.  Two  3/8 inch
	screwed rods  to the length of sail height and  the extra length
	required for the connection nuts
	one inch screwed rod [ the length as above ]
	A couple of  one inch diameter ball bearing races  and
	retainers.
	 A selection of nuts and bolts or rivets Three pieces
	large card board 1/4" or thicker the better.  A large base plate
	 this can be metal or wood but must be able to be secured so
	that the wind does not blow assembly over.  A collection of
	permanent bar magnets or electro magnets.
<P> 
	Construction
<P> 
	With the aluminium sheeting cut six circles to the diameters you
	wish each will need a one inch hole in centre of each circle.
	drill also two 3/8 holes  on the outer diameter  on the same
	radius from the centre, these will be used by the 3/8 inch screwed
	thread  in supporting the outer portions of the sail wings.
<P> 
	You will need to make three of the following
<P> 
	Cut a sheet of cardboard to the exact diameter of the aluminium
	circles.
<P> 
	The cardboard is used to add strength to the sandwich construction
	without adding too much  extra weight.
<P> 
	Make a sandwich with the cardboard in the center and two
	aluminium circles on the outside.  Drill holes on outer diameter
	of circles and bolt together the construction together.  Weather
	proof the cardboard with paint and weather proofing compound.
<P> 

	Please note plywood could also be used in placed of cardboard
	but will add extra weight to the unit.
<P> 
	You should now have three thick disks sandwiches.
<P> 
	One will be used for the top and the other two will be for the
	bottom under sail and the other to mount the magnets.
<P> 
	Work out the size you wish the curved sails to be and
	cut aluminium sheeting to size ,also leave  two
	inch tabs on the top ,bottom and the two sides.
<P> 
	The tabs are then drilled ready for rivets
<P> 
	Bend all tabs 90 degrees  and  place a sheet in a {C} curve shape
	on the top plate and then  rivet to the top  sandwich disk
<P> 
	Do this with the other sheet but in opposite direction so that
	you end up with a [S] shape rotor.
<P> 
	Insert one inch rod to top sandwich, bolt into position and
	rivet centre side tabs together around the 1" centre rod.

<P> 
	Insert the two 3/8 inch rods into sandwich wing outer support
	holes bend over outer wing tabs and rivet together.
<P> 
	Do the above to the bottom plate and bolt into position.
<P> 
	On the remaining sandwich cylinder place  your permanent magnets
	on the  outer diameter,equally space them,  all can be facing the same
	directions or alternate them.
<P> 
	You could also use bar electromagnets but a couple slip rings
	would be need to be included  in the  design.
<P> 
	Fix magnets in position.
<P> 
	Fix bottom plate to rest of assembly with one inch nuts
<P> 
	Then put 1 inch rotor ends in bearing race on bottom of support
	plate and make  top support for upper bearing support and then
	fix it to bottom  support.
<P> 
	Field magnets maybe transformer  [I] shaped  pieces wound with
	copper wire and mounted as you wish.  You will need to
	experiment with coil windings and core types to get desired
	voltages and currents.
<P> 
	Fix  field pickup coils [ bar type ] into position on the
	support base and line up with rotor assembly magnets.
<P> 
	You may try any configuration you wish so that you get pulsating
	dc or ac, remember only one end of each field magnet pole is
	used, the other faces away.
<P> 
	Make sure unit is secure so that any wind gust will not flip the
	device over.
