             Before I explain this theory, we need to make some things clear.

	The rules you may be able to  confirm  in your public or science
	library.


	The assumptions I make ,I don,t think  you will be able to.

	First Rule

	 Light rays tend to repel.  

	You want an example take crookes tube or it's better know name,
	a radio meter.  Put this bulb with its four spinning vanes  one
	side of each painted black and the other painted white into
	bright sunlight and watch it spin.


	The better the light source the faster the vanes will spin.

	Admitedly the vanes are in a vacuum.


	Now take a man made satellite in space, with a much bigger
	vaccum surrounding it, one side in  light the other in darkness
	and what happens.  Yes that right it spins when the sunlight is
	exposed to it.


	How about working on something a little bigger the Earth perhaps
	A big bulb  in space one side  lit with  light and the one side
	in darkness and sitting in one big mother of a vaccum.


	What do  you think would happen this time.  What does the earth
	do in  every twenty four hour period.


	In science classes we were taught the earth had only one
	magnetic field going north south.

	Could they have been wrong, are there more than one.?


	Thing about this for a while.


	Get a normal magnetic compass and let it line up to magnetic
	north  and south.



	If there were a weaker magnetic field of differing polarity
	would the compass indicate a presence,probably not especially if
	it was only a tandy ceramic ,but the field would exist just the
	same and be overriden by the more powerful one in the vicinity.


	A rule we were taught that at school science, magnetic lines of
	force do  not cross : Therefore if this is true,there could be
	pockets of self contained magnetic fields of differing magnetic
	polarity and strength accuring naturally here on earth.

	yet undiscovered.


	Now to take this one step further,  could there be a large
	magnetic field out there in space undiscovered  or are the
	populus not yet informed about.

	Second Rule

	Light repells magnetic fields

	If there was?  What would be the result of the sun in contact
	with this field?

	Would  the light and magnetic forces balance each other out.

	Could the sun actually move around  a magnetic field in orbit
	and not be a static body  as generally  assumed.

	As you are probably aware  no independent body in space is
	really at rest.

	If the sun moved in this real circular  orbit at the same speed
	it takes earth to orbit the sun, could this be the reason for
	the elliptical orbits the planets take.

	At the differing times in the orbit the magnetic field would
	have a greater influence on the planet  pulling it towards this
	magnetic field.

	Whilst at other times the sun would have a greater influence and
	tend to repel the planet away ,the combination of these two
	forces would balance  out to give an  appearance  of an
	elliptical planetary  orbit.

	Pure conjecture or is it?  You decide for yourself.
