	The idea is credited to a Scottish inventor called Robert
	Stirling in 1816. The idea is that a fixed quantity of air is
	pushed  between two chambers one hot and one cold.  The
	resulting changes in air temperature and pressure can then be
	used to perform work.

	I have seen this little pump in many forms In the late sixty's I
	saw one on a television science program one made entirely  of
	glass with ball bearings for the valves and heat from a from  a
	spotlight to  power the device.  Another I have seen was made
	from metal piping and  heat supplied from a lit gas jet to power
	the device.

	The one in the illustration can be made from cheap plastic
	irrigation water piping fittings  and values from a cheap
	plastic hand liquid pump.

	The one thing common to all models is that all joints be air
	tight.

	The items you will need

	as in illustration  or  to make it a little easier you could use
	small irrigation or garden water fittings that come with
	threaded ends.

	It is then just a case of screwing them together.

	The flat valves could be pieces out of the liquid pump

	Two  three or two litre empty plastic coke bottles with their
	tops .These will be the air chambers one for hot one for cold

	Construction

	The alignment is of as in the illustration.  The illustration is
	pretty clear I believe and  just to add to it, the following
	information may be of assistance to you

	Remove the tops from the coke bottles  and drill a quarter inch
	hole in center of each top

	Cement with plastic  putty  or whatever you have available the
	tops in one side of a  T Piece  make sure that it cannot move
	and is air tight . You will need two of these , and when the
	unit is finished the plastic bottle will be screw into the glued
	plastic tops.

	Connect other pieces as in diagram.  You may use what ever you
	can for valves but they should be light round and flat or even

	a glass marble fitted into a rounded drill hole in flat piece of
	plastic inserted or glued into a irrigation connection piece and

	most important they must  only allow water to flow in  one
	direction and block it from flowing backwards

	The other type of
	valve could be the same drilled hole but with a piece of flat
	rounded plastic resting on top of it  placed on such a way that
	it cannot move sideways but can move freely upwards and downward.

	Priming the pump

	Place suction inlet into source of water  and pour water into
	top of unit  until level with  second  level  piece under
	the plastic bottle tops.  Water should now be flowing out of the
	outlet pipe when correct level is reached

	Place plastic bottles in position ,one bottle should be exposed
	to sunlight  and the other kept as cool as possible.

	Improvements that could be worth trying are

	Put some black paint inside a plastic bottle and roll around
	until the inside surface is covered with the  black paint.  This
	will be the bottle exposed to the solar heat.

	The other could have a large tin can collar with a small hole in
	bottom  of the can to allow the thread of plastic bottle to exit
	and be joined to rest of connections.
	This should have  a water tight seal to prevent leakage.
	When properly sealed, add water to collar and natural evaportion
	will keep thre plastic bootle cooled.

	Or alternately  use more connections so that the bottles could
	be stood right way up  and the cooling bottle put into can from
	the top.

	How it works:

	The invention alternatively pulls up water through  the bottom
	value and then pushes it through the top valve.

	When the air heats up in the hot air bottle pressure expands
	thus forcing the water in tube out .  When the air is cooled
	down it contracts creating a vaccum that pulls water up through
	the bottom and so on.

	The unit should keep working until heat source is removed.  You
	may need to experiment to make this unit work more efficiently.

	Possible use

	Although this is only a demo unit a bigger one could be built
	and used in a hydroponic garden for water cycling or for the
	cooling unit in the solar desalination unit described elsewhere.
