	There are a number variations on this theme.  Some are all
	electronic and  have electronic all switching [power
	transistors]  driven by a variable electronic sine wave
	generator.

	In reality they are the following design as illustrated.

	A twelve volt lead acid battery will usually deliver a voltage
	of between 12 and 13.5 volts, therefore to charge this battery  a
	voltage greater than this would be needed.

	To achieve this four batteries are used, in one half of the
	switching cycle two batteries are connected in series to give 24
	volts and fed to the other two connected in parallel as 12
	volts. In the other half cycle the batteries previously charged
	as twelve volts are now a parallel connection of twenty four
	volts and are now charging the other two as twelve volts.

	On the diagram the green circles represent switches that are
	activated by motorised activator and are in either on or off
	mode together.  The blue circles represent the other set of
	switches and are off when the green ones are on.

	The arrows represent power diodes and that help direct the power
	flow. The key to making this device work seems to be the
	frequency of the switching  operation.

	This is achieved by a variable speed electrical motor driving a
	set of insulated disks with metal contacts fixed to wheels The
	wheels themselves making intermittent contact with outer part
	of the switch [see diagram] when rotated.

	A power rectifier and a full wave bridge convert the pulsating
	current to a dc supply.

	Apparently the right resonance switching triggers something in
	the chemical and electrical characteristics to give better
	charging than expected and resulting in claims of over unity
	power from some constructers.

	The Hendershot Electrical Generator.

	During the 1920's an Inventor in the United States called Lester
	Hendershot produced a device which claimed produced useful power
	of a about 300 watts.  The device proved however to be erratic
	in operation.  The inventor claimed he was tapping the space
	energy field.

	The Hendershot generator consists of a special arrangement of
	two basket weave coils  with each of them being of three coils
	themselves.

	Each basket weave coils were placed around a stainless steel
	cylinder upon which before a full capacitor al foils had been
	wrapped.

	The unit also consisted of two transformers of 5:1 transformers,
	magnetic clapper unit, from which the unit was triggered and
	additional capacitors.

	For those who are interested in the full construction details,
	his son Mark Hendershot who is trying to continue  the work, has
	available a full set of construction plans of the generator and
	details of  his father's  life work.
	A copy can also be obtained from the Tesla bookshop
