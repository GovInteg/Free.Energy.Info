<H2>Some Improvement in the construction of electro magnets</H2>

<P>
<CENTER> <IMG src= "electrom.gif"></center>
<P>
Above is a typical home experimenters construction of an electro
magnet   usually consisting of a soft iron bolt  six inches in
length and approx 1/2 inch in diameter. and usually available
from a hardware store.
<P>
The bolt has a screw thread and two insulated metal washers  to hold the
windings in place and a nut  covering the screw thread.
<P>
The winding consist of 20 swg   insulated magnet wire although
any gauge wire could be used for this purpose.
<P>
Check your electronics or electricity  store  (Radio Shack ) to
get some magnet winding wire.
<P>
I used a twelve volt  car battery to provide power to the electromagnet
  and in this case also   any DC power source could be used.
<P>
The amount of current and voltage needed to energise  an electromagnet
 varies with  wire size and length and will
have  be to be determined by experimentation by yourself and your
friends.
<P>
If you can get some wire resistance and power values for your
wire gauge you may be able to determine the power
required to power your magnet.
<P>
I afraid this is outside the scope of this article   and I encourage
you to experiment yourself   but on no account use
the AC power from your home utility  power supply apart from being
the wrong type of power (AC) is can also be deadly if you don't
know what you are doing (SO BE WARNED).
<P>
Please note the iron bolt should have a layer of insulation wrapped
around it to prevent a possible short circuits and to hold
the washers in place
<P>
The winding wire for a normal electromagnet is wound around the
from the bottom to top in a circular  pattern around the metal
bolt    and when the top is reached   ,I  then use some  common
 sticky cellotape  tape to hold the layer windings in place   and then wind
down towards the bottom .
<P>
I repeat the above processes until sufficient wire and layers
are wound on the bolt core for the magnetic strength required..
<P>
.
<P>
 <CENTER><IMG src= "electron.gif"></center>
<H3>A more stronger electromagnet</H3>

<P>
Using the same components as the description  above , I believe
from experiments I have carried out, I can make a small improvement
in the strength of the induced magnet field in a magnetic  metal bolt for example assuming  of course the same  amount of power
and core winding wire and  then  obtaining a more stronger electromagnet

But the only way to convince yourself  is for you to the perform an experiment and test it for yourself .
<p>
<H3>All instruction as to first diagram above apply </H3>

<P>
but with the exception  that when the top of winding is reached
,the winding wire instead of being  wound to the bottom in several
turns  only one turn is required to bring the wire to bottom ,where
you once again tape it in place and repeat  winding to the top
again until sufficient turns and layers of wire  have been added
to the core.
<P>
Please remember all downward windings  are of only one complete
loop as illustrated above.
<P>
If   you care to repeat my experiment   I believe you will notice
a  stronger electromagnet   with the second design.
<P>

<H2>Making an Permanent Magnet</H2></center>

<P>
This a simple excellent design for making  permanent magnets or
magnetising tools such as screw drive,tools  etc.
<P>
The device  consists of a  double ended screwed casing such as
galvanised domestic water piping ,I used one inch tube   and about
four inches in length.with one end cap as shown  in above drawing.
<P>
Please note the outer  tube must be able to be magnetised  so don't use copper
or plastic piping..
<P>
You will also need to make   a coil winding on a hollow cylinder
 that will fit and then  be able to be insulated from  the outer metal
casing.
<p>
I made a hollow cylinder by wrapping and by placing some paper  glue all over  some A4 paper  and then wrapping
it  around a piece of wooden dowel of suitable diameter.
Remove  the paper cylinder   when the glue is dried and the paper is hard.
It may be a good idea to leave some space between the start of the paper and wooden dowel 
so that the paper cyclinder can be easily  removed
There may be other methods to create the former such as using pvc piping ,if you can get suitable metal casing that will
allow the pvc to   to fit iside  the magnetic metal outer casing with the winding.

<P>
You could use insulating tape over the outer  coil winding  or even  wax   to make sure no
electricity is  able to be transferred from the coil magnetising windings to the
metal  casing  when placed inside the metal pipe and thus shorting out the magnetising device.
<P>
It may be a good idea also to vanish your coil winding ,as this aids in  the insulatation and holds the coil windings in place.
<p>
Put the device together as shown in illustrations 
<p>
The way to make a  permanent magnet is to place  the metal object to be magnetised  in the
centre of the coil wound solenoid   and  then  you 
use a short burst of high  current to power up the coil and then switch
it off  again rather quickly.
<P>
Please note  the higher current value you can use the better  
,a charged capacitor arrangement is ideal and could be used to
provide the high current for a short period when it is discharged
into the coil.
<P>
A high current diode may be needed in this circuit to prevent
the reverse EMF   from de magnetising the metal subject.
<P>
The windings are wound in the same direction as for a normal solenoid
winding.
<P>
By the way this design could also be used as  a excellent solenoid
actuation  switch with the addition of a  return spring.
<P>
Again you will need to experiment with the metal casing ,coil
length ,wire gauge sizes and power to get the desired the magnet
strength.
<p>
<P>
 <CENTER><IMG src= "magtiseb.gif"></center>
<P>
It just occurs to me that if you installed the central  coil and make two drill holes in one of the end caps
to  take the leads from the coil  ,you could then   insert  a metal object to be magnetised in the hollow solenoid coil, 
 and then place  a second end cap at the other end of the metal cyclinder..
<p>
So that when the current is introduced to the coil  all the magnetic field generated  would need to then travel
 through your metal sample  and around the metal casing thus making a stronger magnet  than using a single  end cap as illustrated.
below.
<P>
Remember you cannot magnetize any other object  stronger than
the applied magnetic field.
<P>
 <CENTER><IMG src= "magtisea.gif"></center>
<P>
Similar arrangement to the first magnetiser   but please notice
the one return loop   in each  top bottom arrangement.
<P>
This also gives a better magnetising field   as well  I believe.
<p>
<hr>
<P>
 <CENTER><IMG src= "transf1.gif"></center>
<P>
I haven't tried this idea as shown in following section,
but  I also think a slight improvement may also be noticed in operation.
But at this stage have no way of confirming it    as we are dealing
with AC    not DC  as of the top electro magnets designs .
Other's who are more experienced in the art may be able to help me  here.
<P>
Above is a typical   metal laminated transformer consisted of
 E shaped metal cut out   with an I shaped
metal filler   to complete the magnetic circuit.
<P>
The coil is wound on a plastic former   divided into  two  separate
 winding sections namely primary and secondary output coil windings.
<P>
The winding former is placed in the center of the metal arrangement.
<P>
The power is applied to the primary circuit windings   and is
 either  outputed at the same power levels  ( voltage current
) or used to either step up or step  down    the voltage or current
levels.
<P>
I believe it would be interesting to observe what would happen
if the below arrangement was considered and wound in  accordance
 with modified coil winding arrangement as put forward in the
previous two ideas.
<P>
If you do construct one please don't forget to let me know what your observations
are.

<H2>A Magnetic Bearing idea for  a Adam type Motor</H2>

<P>
If you look at the diagram you will notice   a central plastic or non magnetic  rotor onto
which are mounted a collection  of rectangular magnets at regular
intervals . The magnets I believe are common   to Radio Shack
or Tandy.
<P>
All magnets are positioned that is  all outward facing magnet
poles are the same,     all North   or all South.
<P>
Six  magnets I believe would be ideal although a bigger rotor
would require more.
<P>
The rotor is driven by a current  impulse in a modified single pole  direction  electromagnet (North in this case )
mounted on the outer side and  close to the rotor which  is fired from an
impulse generated into a modified pick up coil and amplified via a transistor
arrangement  from the   opposing side of the rotor
<p>
Please note  both the  pickup coil and the driving electromagnet wound as in a modified design as previously described above.

. <P>
<IMG SRC ="bullet.gif" ALT= bullet > <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/ResearchTriangle/Lab/1135/gyro.htm"> see articles on a Magnetic gyro and Lenz motor  </A>

<P>
 

<P>

<center> <img src="magbear.gif"> </center><p>
The positions of electromagnet and pickup coil  shown are for
ease of drawing and may not be the best position possible.
<P>
Again looking at the diagram you will also see 1 inch  round magnets
at each end of the driving shaft
<P>
( The magnets desired are 1 inch  round Tandy Radio Shack the
ones with a central hole )
<P>
A magnet is mounted at each end of the rotor axel and is in opposition
 to one facing it on the permanent fixed magnets
on brackets at each end.  ( that is North opposing  North      or South opposing  South  )
<P>
The diameter of the axel needs to be small enough so that ends
are able to rotate freely inside the opposing magnets.
<P>
Although only  a single magnets are shown in the diagram  there
is no reason why several could not  be used to increase
opposing magnetic strength..
<P>
At start up the axel at both ends although in opposing mode are
resting on each   end bracket  magnet bottoms due to the combined weight
of the magnets themselves the axel and rotor weight combined.
<P>
When power is sent to the electro magnet The rotor will begin
to spin    and the rotor assembly should lift and a find
a point of balance on the opposing magnet. fields
<P>
The unit is now spinning on magnetic field cushion .
<P>
The device may at this stage have no practical value as yet  but
it would be interesting to watch and ponder any way.
