	Lord Kelvin Water drop experiment
               also see modified Lord Kelvin device
	1892 Lord Kelvin performed the following experiment. In it he
	was able to demonstrate, that he was able to produce static
	electricity charges from the  dripping water.
<P> 
	In the experiment, he suspended a metal tank filled with
	distilled water approx 250mm in width and 600mm  from the base.
	Underneath this tank he inserted two taps to control the flow of
	the dripping water.
<P> 
             Below each tap were two metal cans that collected the water and
	were insulated from the base .
<P> 
            A copper loop was connected to the  opposing cans.
<P> 
	The theory is as  the water drops through the air towards the
	collection can they obtain a small static charge from the air by
	means of friction.
<P> 
	As each droplet is different, one becomes positive and the other
	negative.  Over a period of time the charges built up to flash
	point.  A neon bulb could be connected in series with one of the
	wire loops to enable flash to be better indicated.

	   A Forgotten Experiment
<P> 
	At the beginning of the century  the University of Vienna
	performed the following exercise.
<P> 
	A jet of water under the pressure of 5 times atomosphereic (73psi)
	is forced down  a pipe  with the bottom diameter of 0.2 to .3 mm
<P> 
	Apparently the higher the pressure the better the result. although this may not be the case
<P> 
	At about 30 to 40 cm   in direct line with  the pressurized jet
	there was  a metal container  insulated with paraffin wax on the
	outside and covering the lip.
<P> 
	It was important to have the can insulated from the ground.  A
	wire led from the can to the electoscope to indicate when an
	elctrostatic was present.
<P> 
	Another piece of paraffin wax in a block form was postioned at
	angle a short distance from then thin water flow.
<P> 
	When the water flowed  the meter registered a charge of 10
	thousand volts
<P> 
	A Swedish research group performed an experiment with
	simularities to the Lord Kelvin experiment as perviously
	mentioned  above.
<P> 
	They tried the Vienna experiment  and added a  second jet at
	about 60 cm from the first. The result was a double charge.
	They crossed it with loops as described with Lord Kelvin
	experiment.  They also found the loop had to be  in  a
	horizontal plane and in  a particular  height to be found by
	experimentation for it to work successfully.  They noticed  as
	soon as the static field reach a certain intensity the water
	stream split  and rose back upwards even with 73 pound per
	square inch pressure behind it.
<P> 
	<P> <IMG SRC ="colorbar.gif" ALT=" color line  "><P>

<P> 
	A simple experiment to try for yourself.
<P> 
	Go to the bathroom and turn a tap only slowly. Get a plastic comb
	and rub it with a woolen article. Bring the comb in contract
	with the water stream. When both are close together but not
	touching you should be able to bend the water flow.
<P>

<P> 
              Alvin M. Marks  of the United States of America has invented an
	electrical generator unit the size of a large  ball that uses no
	magnetic fields ,no moving parts.  The unit required  a jet of
	water vapour  and a electrostatic field. He was hoping to build
	a unit in the 10,000 watt range.
<P> 
	This inventor has used similar principles in building a anti car
	pollution  device.

	Second illustration
<P> 
	We all can remember seeing solar panels on spacecraft and now on
	watches and calculators.
<P> 
	Nicola Tesla had an idea for collection  of free energy too.
<P> 
	Nicola Tesla's panel consisted  of a shiny metal panel with a
	transparent  coating  which now days could be the clear plastic
	you can get from a spray cans.
<P> 
	This Panel had advantage over the others in that it would be
	used at night as well as the day.
<P> 
        The bigger the shiny metal surface  area and the higher up the
	better the output.
<P> 
	The metal plate was to connect one end of capacitor and the
	other side to a good earth connection.
<P> 
	To get the power output the condensor would be switched into a
	load at  intervals to transfer the power stored in the
	capacitor.
<P> 
	At any given height above the ground there is an electrical plus
	potential  the higher up the more stronger  and a negative one
	at ground level.

<P> 
            The capacitor that was to be used was to had have a considerable
	electrostatic  capacity and a very good dialectic preferable
	mica.
<P> 
	When asked what he felt the potential of his ideal would be , he
	thought it would be a thousands of times more powerful than the
	crookes radiometer.
<P> 
	Unfortunately for Tesla and us he ran out of funds and the
	device was never  constructed or tested.
<P>

	Third illustration.
<P> 
	This is the only design of a device of it kind , I have see that
	gives a high electro static charge on demand and has some thing
	similar  to the make up of electrets used in microphones.
<P> 
	The instructions given me to are below

<P> 
	If you have a high voltage source available such as a Van De
	Graff or wimhurst machine you can make one.
<P> 
	If requires you to get a square of lucite  [ I suspect that is
	also called perspex here in Australia but am not sure maybe
	someone can enlighten me.
<P> 
	About 5 inches in square should be sufficient.
<P> 
	You will then need to get two pieces of aluminium foil the same
	size and place one piece  below and above the lucite.
<P> 
	Connect the top foil to high voltage static generator source
	connect the bottom to a good earth connection
<P> 
	Now  place it on a stand that will enable you to put a heat
	source under the sandwich  and heat the lucite  to  a soft form
<P> 
	A good heat source  is a barbecue bickete or bunsen burner
<P> 
	Switch on the electro static generator
<P> 
	Set alight to the brickette and melt the lucite square. Leave
	the electro static generator on until brickette has burnt out
	and lucite has cooled to solid mass again.
<P> 
	When  cooled  disconnect the leads  and test unit by shorting
	out the foil covering, there should be a spark.  The beauty of
	this device is  you can continue to do this, and when you finish
	playing with it, be sure to  wrap the entire battery in tin
	foil, to preserve the charge in the same sort of manner as you
	do with a magnet, when you provide a magnetic pathway between
	the two poles to keep the magnetism strong.
<P> 
	I have never actually made this so you may need to experiment
	<P> 
	Question
<P> 
	Is this why some plastic packaging material seems to have a
	static charge or is very  clingy,  Is there something in the
	manufacturing process that promotes the forming of a charge.
