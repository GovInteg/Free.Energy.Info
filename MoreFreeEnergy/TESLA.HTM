Telsa High Frequency Electrical Generator
<P>
	In the early years when Nicola Tesla had his laboratory in New
	York, he  made a simple vibration device powered by air.  It was
	simple in construction and having no valves , one air inlet and
	only  one moving part.
<P>
	Although power required is hazy, it was suggested he used only
	1/25 horsepower to run it.
<P>
	 When he had the unit connected to a metal pillar in his
	building and when he had it running some time,  there was
	resonance build up enough  in  the surrounding  buildings to
	cause them to shake and nearly be destroyed.
<P>
	They would have happened to, if he had not stopped  the unit by
	hitting it with a large hammer nearby to stop the resonance.
<P>
	Although I have not seen the unit , I believe it could have
	worked in principle like the unit illustrated.
<P>
	The design shown is my idea of how it could have been modified
	later by Telsa to generate electrical energy of high alternating
	frequency for transfer of electrical energy without wires.
<P>
	It could be made of metal [preferably] but maybe with modern
	plastic  fittings as well if heat build up is not a problem
	encountered.
        <P>      
               The unit might have been  constructed thus:
<P>
	A single cylinder closed off at one end with a drill hole small
	enough to hold a single piston  rod .
<P>
	On the bottom of the shaft is a piece of plastic that seals
	bottom hole in position when shaft is in down position.
<P>
	Next up is an air delivery position.
<P>
	Further up the piston is a piece of circular metal that makes a
	air tight seal.
<P>
	Rubber seals or oil possibly be used to ensure a complete air
	tight fit.
<P>
	Above this is a set of magnets that move through a  coil of
	wire.
<P>
	The weight above is designed  to help move the assembly down
	when air pressure drops.
<P>
	Secure top of unit so that rod can only travel up and down
	without side ways movement.
<P>

A Slight Variation
<P>
	The piston arrangement could be different in that no hole needs
	to be drilled  in the bottom of cylinder.
<P>
	Use a cup or tin can for outer cylinder and fed with air in from
	side.
<P>
	Place a small cylinder inside can so that rod shaft has
	somewhere to rest securely  and is able to move only  up and
	down.
<P>
	Make a cover that fits over top of can and is air tight when
	rested there when fitted to shaft.  Make a inlet for the air to
	be side delivered into unit.
<P>
	The rest of assembly is as above.
<P>
	The distance the rod needs to travel need not be large as it is
	the higher frequencies we are interested in.
<P>
	You will need to experiment with coil windings, magnetic
	strength and air pressure to get  your desired electrical
	output.
<P>
	Theory Of Operation
<P>
	Air Pressure is delivered through side outlet
<P>
	The air pressure in the cylinder builds up and lifts assembly
	upwards generating electricity in one direction in the coil.
<P>
	When the air pressure drops  due to the bottom hole in the
	cylinder or through the top with cup unit  ,the top weight
	forces unit downwards and generates electricity in opposite
	direction.
<P>
	The whole process repeats until air supply is removed.  I would
	suggest that the Tesla unit be mounted on rubber backing to
	prevent vibration transfer to surrounding areas.  The ideas put
	forward are  not protected by patent as far as I know.
