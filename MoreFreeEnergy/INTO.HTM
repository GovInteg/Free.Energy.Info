In the early sixties I went with a friend to their elderly woman
relation she had a wood fire and was always struggling to find
energy and money to keep that going for warmth. in cold winters
we can have here in South Australia
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I imagined other elderly people in that position every since and
felt there must be way a help them and other in a practical way.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I spent the last 15 years and money on collecting various free
energy patents ,articles etc some possibly are not worth the paper
they were written on ,some I do not know about ,others show possibilities
maybe with a little more experimentation and research by others.
I am presently engaged in electrostatic experiments on a limited
basis when time, finance and my present employment permits on
trying to duplicate the swiss ml machine
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
So I present the information I have collected for two reasons
to inform and stimulate others to action
