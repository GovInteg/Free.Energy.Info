	<P> Powering Electrical Devices with Energy Abstracted from the
	Atmosphere by L.R.Crump  U.S. patent 2,813,242
<P> 
	In the early days of radio  when valves were the norm and very
	expensive, many people were unable to afford them.  A simple
	device called a crystal set was the norm.  It consisted of only
	a few  components, many made by the people themselves.  A coil
	usually hand wound by trial and error.  A tuning capacitor A
	diode which allowed current to travel in one direction   , this
	was usually a piece of galena crystal with a movable piece of
	wire this was moved about on the crystal until a signal was
	obtained.
<P> 
	I have also seen the blue Gilette razor  blade and a lead pencil
	used in the same manner.
<P> 
	Later a crystal diode was introduced which made things
	considerably easier and the final component a head piece  or
	head phones.  The headphones are the most interesting piece as
	far as energy is concerned as current is supplied from the rest
	of the device needed to make then work.  This invention makes
	use of this current to power other devices.
<P> 
	Coil and capacitor are tuned to frequency of a radio transmitter
	from which the  diode rectifies the  signal and delivers a D.C.
	pulsating current , a full wave  rectifier  would give a better
	output.
<P> 
	To deliver an increase in power several  tuned circuits could be
	coupled together.  Results obtained from a 5 Kilowatt standard
	broadcast station from five miles away using  only an indoor
	antenna to pick up the power signal.  2.5 to 3 volts   at 0.5 to
	1 milliwatt. A longer outdoor aerial would give better results
<P> 
	Please note that the newer coils using ferrite rods give a
	stronger signal and the coil can be substituted by one made by
	your self, A few turns are only needed to receive the stronger
	short wave stations  such as radio Australia. Of course  you
	would use  your own short wave station  in your country.
<P> 
	I have found that insulated steel wire coil  gives better results than
	copper.  The diode should also a geranium type in preference to
	others types.
