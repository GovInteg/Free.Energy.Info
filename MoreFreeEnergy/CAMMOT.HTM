	Not much is known about this design I came across in some papers
	I  had laying around.

	This motor consists of four magnets on a rotating cam of three
	magnets placed on spring arms  at every 120 degrees on the
	outside mounting  positions.

	The overall cam  diameter should be seven inches.

	By positioning the outer magnets in these positions a  repelling
	force is   put into effect every 30 degrees

	The repelling  action will last for approx 50 degrees.

	The 20 degree difference should over come the drag and hopefully
	keep  the cam rotating continuously.

	The strength of the magnets will have a large effect in the
	amount of power achieved.

	A slight improvement may occur if  more than three magnets say
	five or even seven  or placed on outer springs.

	This may take some experimenting to work let me know of your success.
