<H3>The Floyd Sweet Vacuum Triode Amplifier Experiments </H3>

<P>
I have heard for some time about the Floyed Sweet Vacuum triode
experiments of which I have seen a small 
<P>
video on the internet of the device in operations but I afraid
like most devices claiming overunity details appear sketchy
<P>
and often incomplete. The following likewise is no different.
<P>
The following is copied from a paper from the Space Energy Journey
and as I saw no copyright information on the information , so
I reproduce some of it, for the benefit of others.
<P>
The edition is the Volume VI Issue II  June 1995 .Editor Jim Ketter
and consultant Don Kelly
<P>
May 18 1995
<P>
The accompany data describes the Mark II V.T.A unit which is generally
based on the previous VTA project of 1992/3
<P>
This present Mark II variation of the V.T.A concept is quite interesting
since the input and output coils are at right angles to each other
which may be a significant and useful departure from the previous
designs.
<P>
Builders of the present Mark II unit must be advised that Sparky's
data here  may be filled with errors and flaws, and most of the
specifications  must be started up from scratch.
<P>
We are not quite sure why Sparky presents such Flaws in his Data
releases, but they are so glaring as to defy description and make
us question the value of this project work, at this point!
<P>
An example of such flaws are the input coil data, ie, 250 turns
of #20 gauge (assumed) magnet wire, which make a coil length of
8 inches long.
<P>
The core material is not specified but presumed to be thin gauge
iron or steel to provide a continuous magnetic field between the
magnets.
<P>
When one tries to fit in this 8" long coil into the specified
rectangular -- aluminium tube, we run into trouble ,and must make
changes.
<P>
Obviously ,if the first modification is selected ,this 250 turn,
#18 gauge wire more the core length 8" long coil which further
aggregates the "aluminium shield " problem. It appears
practical to build an aluminium sheet box in a rectangular form
within the two magnetic plates.
<P>
The Status of this project work as of August 97 the web master
has no additional information to add 
<P>
(maybe some one can enlighten me) apart from that below.
<P>
One CA. researcher has built this Mark II unit and found the coil
resistances to be much higher than noted, and therefore noted
voltages much lower than stated.
<P>
The Mark II unit here has not yet been tested, but it is now imperative
that we get to the bottom of this Mark II concepts , so we can
either praise it, or throw it out, so that no further time wasted
on it.
<P>

<P>
.
<P>
The Mark II device used two Barium Ferrite 6" by 4"
by 1" magnets and a single input and output coil, Sparky
did not indicate any mention that magnet conditioning was required.
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC ="vta2.gif" alt  " drawing "><A\></CENTER> 
<P>
Details from Lab notes of first successful tests
<P>
Original Test Setup
<P>
Signal generator used to drive exciter coil (Wavetek U.S.A)
<P>
Exciter coil 1.5" diameter 120 turns #20 gauge ( resistance
~1ohm)
<P>
output coil 1.5 " diameter #12 gauge.
<P>
Input 7.5 volts x 3.1u amps =23 u watts
<P>
Output 10.4 volts x 1.84 = 19.15 watts approx 400Hz
<P>
Comments
<P>
Frequency generally affected resistive 1.8 amp 200 watt bulb load
proportionally- brightness increased with frequency ,decreased
with frequency except at certain points when it appeared inversely
related ,increasingly as frequency decreased etc.
<P>
First Modifications
<P>
The Signal generator was replaced with a purpose built Sine Wave
Oscillator of nine volts output. The exciter coil was increased
to 250 turns #18 gauge (1.024) and the output coil was increased
to 24 turns of #8 gauge (1.024).magnets, spacing etc. all remained
the same.
<P>
Input =7.2 volts by 143 uamps =.001watts
<P>
Output 24.2 volts by 4.6 amps =111watts frequency 388 and 402
Hz
<P>
Comments
<P>
by increasing the area of the wire exposed to/or occupying the
fluctuating magnetic field the output was doubled. Exact proportions/ratios
of the space filling volume of windings to output have not yet
been determined.
<P>
Magnet size seems to be secondary to volume of the windings wire,
diameter, input voltage and current.
<P>
Current limited by wire impedance only rises dramatically in the
field to several hundred kohm from impedance external to the field
of 2-3 @ 400 hz (250 turns #18 (1.0mm)
<P>
AC excitation current is only required to support  I2R  losses
the magnetic field requires no power, is not loaded by wires passing
through field etc.
<P>
Whole unit ran 10 -12 hours with no heating but no longer duration
tests were performed.
<P>
Test were witnessed by three people.
<P>
Technical Notes.
<P>
Quality of oscillator is important- there should be no harmonic
distortion ie. pure sine wave output.
<P>
Signal diode divides the current into the circuit, being parallel
-puts a small microamp current into the power coil as well as
the excitation coil. This works with the magnets in such a way
that there is produced a vector complementation.
<P>
Bulbs vibrate in close proximity to the magnets.
<P>

<P>
In earlier units
<P>
It may be also true that previous magnetic were conditioned in
s special way by have three coils wound right angles
<P>
to each other as shown in the diagram above  but can not proving
each way.
<P>
If the following is true it seems that there was a need to create
a special bubble in the permanent magnet that was made of barium
Ferrite  of maybe grade 5 or grade 8  spaced 3 inches apart.
<P>
Apparently it may be difficult to obtain these type of magnets
today as they have been with drawn from general manufacture.
<P>
It seems a high electrical pulse was needed  in coils A and B
to bring the P/magnet into this condition 
<P>
After the conditioning  this device was left running for several
hours but power output was know to vary depending on time of day.
<P>
It seems the output coil consist of 20 gauge magnetic consisting
of several hundred turns with a large resistance component. .It
is assumed not confirmed  that the coils are bifilar wound with
current flowing in opposite directions.
<P>
The conditioning process also seems to determine the operating
frequency.
<P>
One interesting side effect  noticed as well with other machines
is they tend to run cold suggesting this is a different type 
of power with the effects obtained with normal electricity.
<P>
It is also reported that 9 volts was enough to get the unit to
output power.
<P>
If anyone as additional information I would like to hear about
it.
<P>
I also believe the operation of this device has similarities to
the Swiss ML machine.
