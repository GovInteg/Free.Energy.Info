	Atmospheric Potential Gradient Motor

	A simple motor using electrostatic energy gathered from the air
	or from a electrostatic machine.

	The device consists of one split armature of two semi circular
	metal disks mounted on a smaller insulated disk mounted to a
	common axle.

	On the arm supports are bolted four metal face  plates  one to
	left ,one to right in the front and two in the rear of the
	rotor.

	The face plates cover the entire disk surface with a gap through
	the centre where they are not joined and where the axle comes
	through.

	The Face plates on the left hand are connected to an aerial as
	long as possible  to gather sufficient static electricity.

	A small piece of wire is soldered to the face  plate and the
	other end makes  contact with the rotor plate.

	The right hand side is similar except it is connected to good
	earth.

	How it works

	The unit works by the aerial gathering a static charge from the
	air and transferring it to the left face plates and then to the
	rotor face.  As both metals now have the same charge a repelling
	effect takes place and the other side of the rotor with an
	opposite charge is attracted to this position.  As soon as the
	rotor face come into contact with the solder wire it acquires
	the same charge and the  process is repeated.

	A high aerial or good electrostatic machine is a must along with
	a good earth.

	The unit is built from Plastic and aluminium.  The axle supports
	should not be tight as to prevent the rotation of the axle.

	The measurement and construction details are under construction.
