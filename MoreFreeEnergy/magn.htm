<H3>A magnetic experiment </H3>

<P>
When I was playing around with some magnets I noticed this interesting
effect
<P>
The apparatus is something like  above.
<P>
It consist of two 1'' round magnetic I purchased from a Radio
shack or Tandy store other electronics hobby shop may be able
to provide something simular.
<P>
They are mounted on two   metal plates the magnets will hold to
, the ones I used were purchased from a hardware store for a couple
of dollars
<P>
and are used for patio construction you may use, something simular
as parts are not critical.
<P>
Mount so that the two magnets oppose one another  that is North
to North   or South to South. and about 1/4" inch apart or
closer.   
<P>
The magnets can be mounted to the plates with insulating tape
for ease of construction..
<P>
Now if you get  a separate piece of metal  and place it near the
two magnets you will notice a stronger pull than if the magnets
are in a north to south alignment.
<P>
POSSIBLE  APPLICATION
<P>
This arrangement could lead to  a type of a electro pulsed electromagnet
motor with poles in simular arrangement to drive 
<P>
pulsed dc simplified motor   shown below    or indeed an AC pulsed
motor.
<P>
The design below is a simplified drawing of how this could work
and may not be an ultimate design.
<P>
It consist of six electromagnets on each side  pulsed in a 1 2
3 order and in sequence with the position of the metal portion
of the rotor.
<P>
the drawing is viewed from one side but set of electromagnets
are employed directly opposite the first set.
<P>
I don't claim this motor would have any overunity possbilities
but could be used in driving such.
