	Scrap metal battery
<P><P> <IMG SRC ="colorbar.gif" ALT=" color line  "><P>

 
	Salt dissolved in water  with two strips of different metals can
	be used to make a battery.
<P> 
	The reaction that causes this flow of electricity dissolves one
	of the metals and then plates it on the other electrode.
<P> 
	The metals that could be used are copper ,iron,tin, zinc and
	aluminium A scrap battery could be made using any two these
	metals  by  placing the  differing metals in alternate rows.
<P> 
	Suspend the metals from insulated supports into the brine
	solutions.  It is recommended that copper be one of the metals
	used in your battery.
<P> 
	Use salt to water in the  ratio 10:1 that is 5 pounds of  water
	by weight to 1/2  pound  of salt.
<P> 
	Attach a wire to each electrode and wire either as series
	connection or parallel connection.
<P> 
	Each metal pair combination will give approx .5 of volt, the
	current level will depend on the plate area.
<P>

<P> 
	Alternate use     not illustrated
<P> 
	Unit employing the electro gravitational desalination of saline
	water U.S. patent no 3,474,014
<P> 
	The invention is owned by  General Marine Technology Corporation
	the address is unknown maybe someone can help me.
<P> 
	They seem to encourage experimenters to build their own units
	but would get upset if built for commercial profit
<P> 
	In this application  several combinations of copper tubing  and
	aluminium rods cells are placed standing upright.
<P> 
	Each cell is separated from one another  and has an inlet some
	where near the bottom  of  the copper tube length
<P> 
	A area is provided to collect the increase brine concentration
	at bottom of each tube cell.
<P> 
	A water outlet is provided on opposite side of cell in the
	copper tube near the top and fed to the bottom of the next one.
<P> 
	Above this is an electrical connection between the copper tube
	and aluminum provided by  a 10 ohm resistor and clear of the
	brine.
<P> 
	For a hundred gallons a day  unit the following are required, a
	scaled down unit would produced less fresh water and current.
<P> 
	copper tubing 1" diameter X.03 wall by 64 inches long
<P> 
	 660 required	     3,520 feet in total.
<P> 
	Aluminium rod of same length 1/2 inch diameter use P.V.C.
	tubing to provide connections between cells
<P> 
	A means needs to be  provided to remove the  brine  from
	bottom of each tube cell at periodic times when there is a build
	up of high concentration of salt crystals.
<P> 
	This means opening tubes at the bottom for a fraction of a
	second while the  unit is still running to remove the salt build
	up.
<P> 
	There are 30 rows of cells and 23 cells to the row
<P> 
	Water flows from the bottom to top in each cell one after the
	other.
<P> 
	If you want to replace the 10 ohm resistors connect each cell in
	series so that extra voltage is added from each cell
<P> 
	The electrical circuit must be completed for this unit to work
	and why not a motor.
<P> 
	From information obtained the average total of 996 watts would
	be available so this should be enough to drive a small water
	pump of 1/4 to 1/3 hp to supply filtered sea water  or bore
	water to the  unit.
<P> 
	The aluminium rod is fixed inside copper tube with 1/4" space
	all around  to allow the  water freedom to flow out of the
	bottom and the top and inside between the copper tube and
	aluminium rod.
<P> 
	Brine is fed very slowing from the bottom of the copper tubing,
	and an  electro galvanic response takes place where in simple
	terms the salt ions are send to the bottom outlet zone.
<P> 
	Meanwhile because there is a flow of water the  lesser  dense
	salty brine is carried out to  the top and fed to bottom section
	of another cell and so on until water becomes pure.
<P> 
	Power supply is directly related to the desalination activity
	and from time to time the aluminium rods will become coated with
	hydroxides these can be removed by use  of a vibrator   on each
	aluminium  rod  to shake the hydroxides loose.
<P> 
	Care should be exercised during the vibration exercise as there
	is the danger of an electrical short  or an electrocution.
<P> 
	The minimum flow rate should not be less than 10% of the optimum
	flow rates in units over 10 gallons.
<P> 
	This unit functions not only as a water desalinator but as power
	source as well.

	Babylon battery
<P> 
	In the early history  of what is now as  Iraq  then know as
	Babylon there is evidence that they knew how to make batteries.
<P> 
	Researchers found a small clay pot with two differnt metal
	pieces in it and could not work out what it did.
<P> 
	Until one of them poured some vingar in it  and connected leads
	to a multimeter and found it gave a current.
<P> 
	These people certainly knew how to make wine and some must have
	turned to vinegar and they also knew how to work metals in their
	weapons.
<P> 
	It is suggested it was  kept secret by  the early citizens of
	 Iraq and those in the know, who  used it to electroplate items
	to look like gold and then they passed them off as the real
	thing  to early tourists.  A real good  money earner for the
	time.
