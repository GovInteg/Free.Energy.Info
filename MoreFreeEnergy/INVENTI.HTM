<P> 
	Below are a few inventions that could  or could have changed the
	way we do things
<P> 
	The Bascle carburetor
<P> 
       was patented in the fifties it was supposed to raise mileage by
	50% and reduce pollution 45%
<P> <P> <IMG SRC ="colorbar.gif" ALT=" color line  "><P>


	Kendig Carburetors
<P> 
            Produced  an invention called the variable venture carburetor.
	most were hand made.  claimed to double fuel economy.

	Super Carburetor
<P> 
	A canadian inventor C.N.Progue in the late thirties developed a
	carburetor which claimed to give 200mpg.

	Water to gas
<P> 
	Guido F. Franch demostrated a water to gas mixture  ,according
	to chemists it worked better than petrol.  According to Franch
	his secret was to use coal powder in his conversion.
<P>

              Burning water
<P> 
	in the thirties early tractors used three tanks a tank  for
	petrol,another for kerosene and one for water.
	After using the petrol to start the tractor they then switched over to a cheaper
	mixture of kero and water.
<P> 
	Petrol and water mix
<P> 
	United International Research presented a report they were using
	a mixture of 50% water , 45% petrol,alcohol and a bonding agent
	which kept the formulation together.
<P> 
	<P> <IMG SRC ="colorbar.gif" ALT=" color line  "><P>

Ultrasonic Fuel Systems
<P> 
	used ultra sonics to vibrate existing fuels to a smaller size a
	20 % increase was expected from these units.
<P> 
	Super Milage from Fuel Vapourization.
<P> 
	car fuel was heated in fuel tank and then  vapour fed into
	carburetor several inventors got positive results, but was not
	taken up for some reason.
<P> 
	<P> <IMG SRC ="colorbar.gif" ALT=" color line  "><P>

The Alexander Fuelless Car System
<P> 
	Robert Alexander  put together a small 7/8 12 volt motor that
	provided the power to start and when going a air and hydraulic
	took over recharging  batteries.  U.S. Patent 3913004
<P> 
	<P> <IMG SRC ="colorbar.gif" ALT=" color line  "><P>

Salters Ducks
<P> 
	Large floats moving up and down with ocean tides to produce
	electrical energy. scale models worked well.
<P> 
	<P> <IMG SRC ="colorbar.gif" ALT=" color line  "><P>

Zubris Electric car circuit design
<P> 
	the Zurbis invention cut energy drain on starting by 75% the
	design is claimed to have doubled the efficiency of the electric
	motor  U.S patent 3,809,978)(31)
<P> 
	<P> <IMG SRC ="colorbar.gif" ALT=" color line  "><P>

Air Powered Engines
<P> 
	in 1816 a Scottish inventor Robert Sterling designed an egine
	that  ran on hot air.  in 1975 British atomic energy commission
	came up with a liquid version which was nothing more than pipes
	and valves.
<P> 
	<P> <IMG SRC ="colorbar.gif" ALT=" color line  "><P>

Electostatics
<P> 
	When static electricity is made to flow over a red
	hot object it is cooled.
	The tabernacle of the christian bible seems to be a large
	electro static collector and storage unit.  Rumuor has it that a
	device of the biblical dimension  was built in  the seventies
	but found it too dangerous to let it remain.
<P> 
	<P> <IMG SRC ="colorbar.gif" ALT=" color line  "><P>

Flying Disks
<P> 
	John Searl of England built what he called levity disks while
	working on electrical motor he noticed emf was given off as it
	wa spun.  He claims to have built a disk  which glowed pink and
	then disappeared.  He also claimed his disk designs created a
	vaccum around his craft and once free'd of gravitation
	attraction forces, it disappeared.  Also claims to have built
	several others.
<P> 
	<P> <IMG SRC ="colorbar.gif" ALT=" color line  "><P>

Laithwaite Anti Gravity
<P> 
	Prof Eric Laithwaite devised an anti
	gravity machine consisting of two spinning gyro scopes.  It
	depended on the assumption that no energy was required to return
	gyroscopes to original starting position.
<P> 
<P> <IMG SRC ="colorbar.gif" ALT=" color line  "><P>

	Lyle D.Atkins
<P> 
	Of Houston worked out a method to convert organic
	moistened waste material between aluminium and copper electrode
	plates to produce electrical energy of any size.  It was said a
	special bacteria was also involved.
<P> 
	<P> <IMG SRC ="colorbar.gif" ALT=" color line  "><P>

              Physicist Alvin M
	Marks patented an electrical generator .  the
	device was two foot long put out 10 watts and 50,000 volts of
	D.C.power using nothing but a jet of electrical charged air and
	water vapour.  Charged particles shot from  the generator unit,
	hit a repulsive field, build up  an electrical charge and then
	raced towards a collector unit where the charge is removed.

	DE Land Frost Guard Orchard Protector
<P> 
	An American orchadist has ditched his frost protection devices
	and installed the following.  Starting with a 32 foot high tower
	from which spring  seven underground wires from the top of the
	tower and out to max radius of 144 feet from the tower.  At the
	end of each wire there is a 5 inch alnico magnet which was wound
	with wire.  The magnets were pointed towards the north pole and
	towards the tower slightly 45 degrees There was  just enough
	excess wire to extend beyond the soil and point in alignment
	towards the top of the tower.  One of the seven wires  was in
	carefully alignment to the magnetic north pole

Pharoahs Pump
<P> 
	In the nineteen thirties inventors become interested in the
	pyramids and though it was one big water pump.  several models
	were built between years 40' to 60' and functioned Despite
	patent being granted  it never took off.
