<B>Electrolytic Decomposing Gas Generator by Bernard Klein Baltimore
Md</B></h2>
<P>
<B>Application June 29 1942 serial number 448,891  </B>
<P>
<B>Patent April 3 1945    2,373,032</B>
<P>
<I>I though this invention needs to be looked at again and may
give some ideas for inventors dealing with hdrogen fuels for cars
and if it works could be the answer to using hydrogen without
the need of safe storage compartments for hydrogen  (web page
master)</I>
<P>
This invention refers to fuels for internal combustion engines
and more particularly to be used in decomposing or extracting
gases from liquids such as water and then arranging then for use
as an explosive mixture in engines of the internal combustion
type. It has among  its objects to provide a device that will
separate   combustible gases from the liquid compounds having
same chemically combined in them ,as for example :oxygen and hydrogen
from water ,through an electrolytic process. Another object is
to have the device of such construction as to be readily adaptable
for insertion or connection among the parts of a conventional
internal combustion engine of the automobile ,airplane ,boat or
other type  without requiring radical or complicated arrangements
for the purpose and capable of practical employment.
<P>
A further object is to provide for the operation of the device
in a convenient  manner with adjustments it to meet varied conditions
encountered during operation. A further object is to provide a
device that will automatically supply treated water or other liquid
medium as needed for the device.
<P>
A further object is to have the device adaptable for adjustment
 by remote control or at a distance from the operator or user.
It is a particular object of the invention to construct a self
contained unit that can be applied to an internal combustion engine
;and take relatively small space and be attached thereto in a
compact and attractive manner.
<P>
Other objects will become apparent as the invention is more fully
set forth.
<P>
There has been difficulty here to fore in employing the combustible
gases of relatively inexpensive liquids, such as water, for power
development due to  the cost of equipment ,its cumbersome nature,
and cost of operation. this invention is intended to relieve this
situation by providing a simple manner for manufacture of explosive
gases by decomposing same from liquids that are normally harmless
and inexpensive.
<P>
A typical form of internal combustion engine furnished to propel
an automobile, aircraft, boat or the like has fuel tank, carburetor,
ignition.
<P>
The fuel consists of gasoline or other hydrocarbon that runs from
the tank to the carburettor, a current of air is drawn over the
liquid and takes up the vapour and mixes the later  to form an
explosive mixture, to operate the internal combustion engine.
This system has been found satisfactory as long as sufficient
as a sufficient supply of gasoline or other fuel oil was available
to meet it needs. Under present conditions the demand has increased
and far exceeds supply. Any additional system of fuel production
that will be less costly and can use ingredients that can be found
readily at hand and not here to before used for the purpose herein
described affords attractive possibilities. In this invention
the fuel tank is filled with water to which has been added an
electrolyte, usually sulphur trioxide or sulphuric acid to increase
its conductivity so an electric current will pass through it.
The fluid is then passed from the tank to the generating device
by a pump, vacuum tank ,gravity or whatever system for the fuel
supply the vehicle may be equipped with. The device is  preferably
placed between the fuel tank and engine and used with existing
carburettor. The device can be placed in the system conveniently
as it takes little room, is of simple form and has effective arrangement
for attachment to the system. An important feature of the device
is in the fact that it has arrangements for augmenting the supply
of gas generated by the device. Another important feature of the
device is that part of the gas generated may be used to replenish
its respective auxiliary tube.

<P>
Similar reference characters refer to similar parts through the

<P>
In the drawing which indicates a water generator 1 by way of example,
a source of electricity <B>35</B> is employed for converting the
water into oxygen and hydrogen gases. The generator is preferably
of hollow cylindrical form, with its upper wall supporting partitions
<B>3</B> dividing the interior into two compartments <B>6</B>
and <B>7 </B>respectively and with an intermediate chamber<B>
60</B>. A space <B>4</B> is left  between the lower portion <B>58</B>
of the partition and the floor <B>5 </B>of the generator as indicated
in figure<B> 1</B>. The liquid <B>8</B> is to be processed in
conducted to the bottom wall <B>5</B> into the generator through
a pipe<B> 9</B> connected with the liquid reservoir tank <B>10</B>.
The end portions of the generator have screw threaded holes <B>51</B>
and <B>52 </B>into which insulators <B>53</B> and <B>54 </B>respectively
screw. The insulator <B>53</B> holds the negative cathode terminal
<B>11</B> and insulator <B>54</B>, the positive anode terminal
<B>12</B>. The insulators and terminals are water tight and are
constructed to serve as stuffing boxes. The terminal <B>11</B>
and <B>12</B>  project into compartments  <B>6</B> and <B>7</B>
respectively  and contact the liquid within. Electricity from
a suitable source <B>35</B> feed the terminals when it  is desired
to decompose the liquid, which in  this instance is water, into
component gases oxygen and hydrogen. The water is acidulated with
sulphur trioxide (SO2) to improve its conductivity and electrolytic
decomposition. The current passing into the water, when the circuit
<B>36</B> is operating  causes hydrogen gas to liberate at the
cathode terminal <B>11 </B>and oxygen at the anode terminal <B>12.</B>
This is usually indicated  by bubbles forming and arising from
the terminals. 
<P>
The hydrogen gas collects in the compartment <B>6</B> and rises
above the water into this space <B>16</B> and flows out of the
outlet <B>18</B> into piping that conducts it to a cylinder when
it is stored. Oxygen  accumulating at terminal <B>12 </B> passes
into compartment <B>7</B> thence through liquid into the space
<B>17</B> . From thence it passes into the piping <B>28.</B> The
piping is provided with check valves <B>19</B> and <B>34</B> ,
fittings <B>20</B> and <B>30</B>, carburettor <B>22</B> pipes
<B>21,22,27,33,28</B> and <B>39</B>, valves <B>25,29</B> and <B>37</B>
as indicated in the drawing. The internal combustion engine used
for the operation is designated as <B>24 .</B> A by pass  connection
with conventional accessories indicated to 
<P>
eliminate the carburettor aw may be required at any time. the
hook up comprises  valves <B>63</B> and <B>61</B> and check valve
<B>62</B> and pipes <B>64</B>. The circuit <B>36</B> when its
switch <B>46</B> is closed causes electricity to flow  the acidulated
 water from anode <B>12</B> to cathode <B>11.</B> This breaks
up molecules of water into hydrogen  and oxygen. The hydrogen
arises from the cathode<B> 11</B> into space <B>16</B> in chamber
or compartment<B> 6</B> and the oxygen from the anode terminal
<B>12</B> into the compartment 7; The partition <B>3</B> serving
to keep them apart and segregated.
<P>
The space <B>4 </B>allows the water to move freely from one compartment
of the generator to the other. The current also can pass through
the water without obstruction by the partition . the partitions
 however mechanically prevent the hydrogen and oxygen mixing with
each other in the generator .Any  tendency of either  hydrogen
or oxygen to stray outside of their respective compartments is
prevented by the intermediate chamber <B>60</B> which collects
them. such stray  gases are removable through an outlet pipe <B>65
</B>,provided for the purpose . The vibration of the generator
under any use in the vehicle mentioned will not be sufficient
to mix the gases by reason of the partitions <B>3</B> and the
intermediate chamber <B>60</B> functioning as described. Pumps
<B>66</B>  or other conventional arrangement are utilised in the
outlet piping <B>18</B> and <B>29</B>, to force the hydrogen and
oxygen respectively out of the compartments <B>6</B> and <B>7</B>
through piping <B>21</B> and <B>39</B> to the mixer or carburettor
<B>22</B> on their way to the engine <B>24</B> to be ignited by
spark plugs <B>57</B> and ignition system <B>68</B>.
<P>
The hydrogen and oxygen are preferably combined through the medium
of the spark and in doing so explode powerfully. The explosion
causes the engine pistons to reciprocate and operate the engine
in the usual manner. Low pressure explosions  can be induced through
a stoichiometric mixture of hydrogen and oxygen at a suitable
ignition temperature. Ribs <B>72 </B>provide expanding mechanical
space and prevent the liquid from sloshing back and forth .In
the operation of the device the tank <B>10</B> is filled with
water to which has been added  sulphur trioxide  or sulphuric
acid  so increasing its conductivity. The tank is located high
enough so that the liquid can run down into the generator. <B>1</B>
by gravity, or supplied to the gas generator by the fuel pump
or other lifting method which then exists  in the automobile 
or other vehicle to which it is applied. The anode terminal <B>12</B>
is connected to the positive side of an electric battery or other
electrical source, and the cathode<B> 11</B> is connected to the
negative side of the electric source. A switch<B> 46</B> completes
the electrical  connections and may be placed on the instrument
board convenient to the operator.
<P>
When the electric source is turned on by switch <B>46</B> bubbles
will form around the cathode and anode terminals and will arise
through the solution and be collected in their respective chambers
or spaces. The valve  <B>37</B> is opened and pump <B>66</B> started
and allows gas to flow through pipes <B>21</B> and check valves
<B>19</B> into carburettor or other mixing device <B>22 </B>which
is opened  or closed by lever <B>38</B>. Oxygen flows from this
space <B>17</B> through check valve <B>34 </B>fitting <B>30</B>
pipe <B>28</B> pump <B>66</B> valve <B>29</B> and pipe <B>39</B>
into the carburettor or other mixing device<B> 22</B> where the
hydrogen is properly mixed with air <B>40</B> or  oxygen to give
proper combustion  after which the mixed gases are conveyed to
the internal combustion engine where they are ignited similarly
to present day use of gasoline or fuel oil in internal combustion
engines. an auxiliary cylinder <B>31</B> of oxygen is attached
to pipe <B>33</B>. valve <B>32</B> to supplement the supply of
gases developed by the generator ,or may be used when it is desired
to remove the generator from the lines for repairs etc. The generator
can be constructed  compactly and mounted close to the engine.
lock nuts <B>14</B> provide  for adjustments of electrodes and
for attachment of electric wires thereto:
<P>
The generator itself is preferably of insulating materials such
as any well known plastic, in order to increase efficiency of
the generator and prevent conducting of electricity to the walls
where the action would be slightly short circuiting. The ribbed
or corrugated bottom surface <B>5</B> serves to create an interruption
in the movement of the molecule or ions energised to a breaking
point by the electric current flowing from the electrode <B>12</B>
and <B>11</B> respectively. The breaking point is that condition
arising just prior to the separation of the water molecules (
or other substances acted upon) into their atoms oxygen and hydrogen.
The effect of this curvilinear and obstructing  construction seems
to be that of a mechanical disturbance or collision to the flow
of the ions  causing them to collide more easily and to introduce
separation of the atoms more quickly than without it. This improves
the effectiveness of the generator and increases the efficiency
of the process.
<P>
The walls of the tank <B>1</B> are given their corrugated form
inside to reduce the sloshing of the water in the lower portions,
whilst the upper surfaces thereof serve to entrap the gases and
induce them to deposit their particles of loose water thereon
and cause the latter to drip back into the main body of the water.
This keeps the escaping gases relatively dry. The partitions <B>3
</B>serve to co-operate with the corrugations in preventing sloshing
and reducing the escape of moisture from the chamber <B>60</B>
to the chambers <B>15</B> and <B>17.</B> This also diminishes
any tendency of the incoming water to appreciably disturb the
level of the water in the electrode chambers.
<P>
The chamber <B>60</B> acts as a cushion device.
