<H3>Electrical Current Generator including Torque Reducing Countermagnetic Field </H3>
<hr>
<P>
ELECTRIC CURRENT GENERATOR INCLUDING TORQUE REDUCING COUNTERMAGNETIC
FIELD.
<P>
I have other devices on my web site along the lines here, but
this one is interesting  on several
<P>
grounds   in that the author mentions the fact the device needs
to be in harmony to function.
<P>
The device has actually been built   and in common with one other
device I  am aware of ,which  decreases the input power when under
a Load.
<P>
The author also has made a video of the device in action.
<P>
The magnet must be in one piece  and has a hole drilled through
the centre of it to accomadate a spinning shaft.
<P>
The author also suggest put several in combination to decrease
input even more.
<P>
For further info suggest you contact the author at the email address
below or the postal address supplied below.

<P>
Box 2091A 
<P>
Shepherd Tx 77371-9222
<P>
U.S.A
<P>
 Describing his invention.
<P>
In the "lenz- test, the core of the coil is not shown, explained,
or for that matter even  seen as an inductor, much less, one that
can be "tuned"
<P>
<P><center>
<IMG SRC ="ger1.gif" ALT=" lenz circuit "><A\> </center> 
<P>
Standing waves will be generated with this arrangement, being
a standing wave a pole of opposition will be generated.
<P>
These are the conditions the "lenz" test were done.The
pole generated at the ends of ll will always oppose the motion,
if ll is formed as part of a complete tuned circuit, meaning providing
a load for ll, generation of a pole 
<P>
that will enforce the motion can be generate.
<P>
To understand this correctly,the core and the coil should be designated
as l1,l2, with this in mind,if a tuned 
<P>
circuit were formed,the load would be l3
<P>
LENZ'S LAW
<P>
The direction of an induced e.m.f. is such that it opposes the
chance that produces it.  for example, if a 
<P>
permanent bar magnet is moved towards a coil that forms part of
a complete circuit, then current flows so that 
<P>
the magnetic field abound the coil repels the magnet, if this
were not the case, no work would need to be done
<P>
 to cause charge to flow, breaking the principle of constant energy"
<P>
(LAWS OF CONSERVATION OF ENERGY)
<P>
this is absolute     wash.
<P>
If a current is made to flow in a coil that is a complete circuit,
1 of 2 possible poles will be formed.  These poles have nothing
whatsoever to do with the "constant energy law", 
<P>
But rather simply a current causing an electromagnetic field to
be formed that must dissipate.  If you are moving a magnet towards
or away from a coil wound on an iron core, but not part of a tuned
circuit, a standing wave will 
<P>
be generated and the pole created will oppose the direction of
motion.
<P>
On the other hand, if a coil is wound on a core that is a part
of a tuned circuit.  see diagram
<P>
<P><center>
<IMG SRC ="ger14.gif" ALT=" lenz circuit "><A\> </center> 
<P>
<P>
If we remove the aluminum from the center part of l-3 and replace
it with a nonconductor, it can be seen that a complete circuit
for the counter force is not present.  This will cause dissipation
of the counter force on first 
<P>
entry of l-3. (steel ends) and not as an inductive load,resulting
in the formation of poles that,will oppose the direction of motion.
<P>
see diagram below.
<P><center>
<IMG SRC ="ger8.gif" ALT=" lenz circuit "><A\> 
<B></B><IMG SRC ="ger9.gif" ALT=" lenz circuit "><A\> </center> 
<P>
<P>

<P>
It can also be seen that if the circuit in the l-3,inductive load
is not complete as a whole unit,generation of a harmonic can not
occur, and with out this you can not shift poles.
<P>
l-1 being the core, l-2 being the coil (e.m.f. out) l-3 being
rotary "tuned load" (l/2 length of l-2) the resulting
electromagnetic field will be obsorbed by l-3.  upon being obsobbed,
the generation of a hormonic will occur as well as a change of
direction of the current. (180 degree phase shift)formation of
the magnetic poles will occur on the harmonic.
<P>
If we remove the aluminum from the center part of l-3 and replace
it with a nonconductor, it can be seen that a complete circuit
for the counter force is not present.  This will cause dissipation
of the counter force on first 
<P>
entry of l-3. (steel ends) and not as an inductive load,resulting
in the formation of poles that,will oppose the direction of motion.
<P>
see diagram below.
<P>
It can also be seen that if the circuit in the l-3,inductive load
is not complete as a whole unit,generation of a harmonic can not
occur, and with out this you can not shift poles.
<P>
for those skilled in the art of transmitter final circuits (xmtr
tank circuits) the diagram 1a below may lend some 
<P>
help in under standing the basic principal of operation of the
generator.
<P>
diagram 1a below has been drawn to show the "l coil"
or inductors so they may be compared to that of a transmitter
final circuit.
<P>
If you remove l3 and the magnet from the diagram, or cover the
two with a piece of paper, and show the top end of ll connected
to an antenna, and connect bottom end of ll to earth ground. 

<P>
It can clearly be seen that this is a basic transmitter tank circuit.
 putting l3 and the magnet back 
<P>
in to place, and now rotating l3 through the space provided between
the magnet and ll, ll being made of steel, induction will occur
in l2 upon rotation of l3, and if a load is placed on l2 a counter
magnetic force will be generated.  with l3 being at the right
place at the right time and of proper length. (aprox. 1/2 the
length of ll) 
<P>
l3 will act as a proper load for the c.f.
<P>
As the counter force is being dissapated a harmonic is being generated
that must dissapate.  l3 not having an inductive path will form
a standing wave at the ends of l3.
<P><center>
<IMG SRC ="ger3.gif" ALT=" lenz circuit "><A\> </center> 
<P>
 This standing wave will cause
the poles at each end 
<P>
to be created.  the poles created will add to the torque  causing
the motion of l3.

It is important at this time I make mention that the "l"
designations ll-l2 and l3 are not shown on the drawing but have
been added at this time to show there functions as a tuned circuit.

<P>
 it is also important that i say that the U.S. patent rules would
not let me show the "L" designations or make mention
or reference to them as the patent process was two far along,
or to put it another way, I did not enter
<P>
 them on the first application, and as such could not enter them
at all.

[571 ABSTRACT
<P>
An alternating electric current generator comprises an armature
rotatably carried by a 
<P>
drive shaft and positioned between stabilized. non-moving magnetic
elements.  The end
<P>
 armature has first and second magnetic field transmitting sections
with a magnetized 
<P>
section sandwiched there between.  As electric load is applied
to the generator, a countermagnetic 
<P>
field is generated through the armature to increase speed of the
drive 
<P>
shaft and thereby lessen torque required to rotate the drive shaft.
