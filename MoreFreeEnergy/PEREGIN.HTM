	<P> 

	A Christian monk by  the name of Peter Peregrinus of circa 1269
	is credited with the design of this type of motor
<P> 
	He used portions of loadstone and nails driven into wooden flat
	disks to give the gearing ratios on the disks.
<P> 
	His original work was translated from the latin.  This idea has
	remained hidden for centuries until a  modified form was
	created by A Californian Mr Lee Bowman.
	Unfortunately he has now passed on.

<P> 
	His device is as illustrated consists of three parallel shafts
	mounted on bearings fixed to a base plate.
	The disks were made from lucite  I suspect this is another name for
	perspex.
<P> 

	The gearing of the disks is a two to one ratio,
	with the centre having the  larger gearing.
<P> 
	The outer gearing is  of the  same size.
<P> 
	The centre disk has mounted on it eight aluminum nickel magnets
	of equal spacing and four magnets on each of the other two smaller
	disks.
<P> 
	The magnets revolve parallel to each other with a gap of .005
	spacing.
<P> 
	A cylindrical magnet is placed at a positional angle in the
	bottom corner of the base plate  so that  it can be used to cause,
	the rotation of the  disk by unbalancing the magnetic forces of the
	unit.
<P> 
	Several witnesses claimed to have seen the device working
	but was later  dismantled due to a lack of interest.
