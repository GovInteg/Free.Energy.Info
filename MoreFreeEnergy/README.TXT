Dear Reader
                       Unfortunately due to the size that the encyclopedia 
of free energy has now grown and it is now not possible to include it so that
it will run directly from this disk.

You will now need to have it  unzipped to a new or separate directory on your
hard disk.

When it has been unzipped you will be able to view it from your net browser 
by choosing INDEX.HTM in your new directory location.

Please note there is also a link in each  htm page that will take your web 
browser back to this  default page.
I hereby give permission for this disk to copied and given  please note NOT
SOLD to friends and acquaintances apart from a distribution cost not 
exceeding $10 USA for share ware suppliers..

If you have obtained the disk in this way please consider forwarding a 
donation to the above address as this is the  only Fund raiser  I have to 
continue this work and research into free energy for our world and then be 
able to provide it at a small nominal cost to all.

Internet use

Parts or whole of this disk may be copied and displayed on th internet as 
long as credit is given to this  Author.{Geoff Egel}

If the whole content is placed on the internet , The credit is already there
and the previous credit message may not be needed.

To place this disk contents  on the web.

It may be easier for you to  create a sub directory on you web site page and
uploaded entire contents to your new web site sub directory and then provide
a link to the htm file  called INDEX.HTM.

Please note if you change this file name INDEX .HTM  you will have to change
the link in all other htm's on this disk to reflect your htm file name 
change..

For the future of free energy
I am
Geoff  Egel
