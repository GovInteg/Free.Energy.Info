	<P>
	This is a very simple solar condensor that will give a small
	amount of pure water each day .This unit is suitable for supply
	water to lead Acid batteries ,but gives too little for a survival
	situation.
<P>
	The unit consists of three main parts.
<P>
	One three litre or a two litre  plastic coke bottle.  One 1.5 kg
	coffee can or larger.  One plastic bottle to collect the
	distilled  water in.  Some plastic drip irrigation hose [small
	size].  assorted drip irrigation threaded connectors [smallest
	you can get].
<P>
	Assembling the unit
<P>
	First thing to do is to cut a  large diameter hole in top of can
	lid.  The bigger the better.
<P>
	Use a nibber to do this, Paint the coffee can  with a good rust
	proofing paint  and then let stand for some time.
<P>
	When dry give several washes to remove paint residue.
<P>
	With the Plastic three litre coke bottle remove top of bottle
	with a sharp  knife  ,just below the start of the dome.
<P>
	Make a circular plastic plate from  a 1/2 inch plastic board
	[ a plastic chopping board is ideal ] to fit inside the tin
	 lid   diameter.
<P>
	In the  circular plastic plate cut a  hole to match the one in
	the tin lid.  [ this is so water vapour can rise ].
<P>
	[ A coping saw may be able to do this ] I used a lathe to make
	this part.
<P>
	Also make a circular groove just inside next to  where the wall
	of the plastic bottle will sit so that water can collect there
	when water has condensed.  Drill a hole in side of
	plastic plate  to link with the groove.
<P>
	Insert a plastic screw thread connector  in drill hole ,glue
	if necessary but preferably just screw into the plastic plate.
<P>
	Fix the modified coke bottle to the circular plastic plate and
	fix to the   top of coffee can lid.
<P>
	How to use
<P>
	Fill the coffee can with water right up to the top, place lid on
	can with the coke bottle fixed to it.
<P>
	Connect  a flexible plastic micro irrigation hose to the screw
	thread on plastic plate and put the other end into a collection
	bottle at a lower level.
<P>

	Place unit in bright sunlight and wait make sure all parts are
	secure as any  strong wind will blow the plastic parts away from
	the unit
<P>

	Operation
<P>

	The water in tin can is heated and rises up towards plastic
	bottle where it condenses and run downs the inside of plastic
	coke bottle towards the groove where it collects and flows
	through the threaded connector  and plastic hose into the
	collector bottle.
