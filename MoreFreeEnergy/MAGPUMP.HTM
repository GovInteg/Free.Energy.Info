	This is a device which makes the use of Fleming's right hand
	rule which if drawn would represent in all directions in a three
	dimension  space that  is [up,down]  [left,right]  [front,back]

	Take one line to represent the direction of the magnetic field
	another to represent the flow of the current and the final one
	to represent the direction of motion.  This holds true from all
	combinations of magnets, current and direction in any form of
	motor.

	A motor usually consists of a stationary magnetic field  called
	the stator and in the middle a rotating magnetic field called
	the armature  fed by a direct current alternated by commuter.

	In this design there is no moving core except the motion of the
	liquid salty water.

	Construction

	Please remember this only an  Experimental Idea

	Obtain a P.V.C. pipe  and cut to length desired.  drill two
	holes directly opposite one  another each side of the pvc  and
	insert  brass nuts and bolts

	These will be the means by which electrical current will flow
	from one contact through the  water and to the other contact.

	Seal around bolt holes so that they  cannot leak water.  Take
	two leads from these points.

	Now mount two magnets permanent or electro magnets over top of
	the contacts and fix into position.

	If you wish to use permanent magnets go to a local vehicle
	wrecker and obtain a windscreen wiper motor .

	Disassemble the motor usually with a hack saw and remove the
	armature section. You should know have easy access to the curved
	magnets inside.

	These will fit ideally around the pvc tubing of the correct size
	and could be held in place with electrical insulation  tape.

	Set up tube and fill with salty water connect up the field coils
	if not a permanent magnet and pass a current through the
	contacts.

	With the correct voltage, current and water conductivity. This
	you will need to determine by experimentation.

	Water should then flow in one direction or the other.

	With greater magnetic strength and wider current flow across the
	direction of  water  flow ,this could conceivable be used as a
	device to propel an aquatic vehicle across water.

	Nuclear power stations already imploy something similar in the
	reactors.

	I came across this idea in some papers I received The idea seems
	to originated from some one  called Richard Lefors Clark Ph.D
	dated 18/3/86 4015 Crown Point drive P-3 San Diego CA 92109

	He seems to suggest a way to generate a strong diamagnetic field
	by pumping water through copper tubing wound in a spiral helix
	using a normal water pump.

	He also seems to suggest that by  putting four to six coils on a
	platform and then turned upside he could levitate the platform.

	Professor Clark

	suggests that if put a normal electric current through the tube
	we get a strong normal magnetic field.

	Suggests also that  the connection of diamagnetism and
	electrical effects has hidden the true nature and utility of
	diamagnetism.

	For evidence he quotes an experiment  performed by Oersted

	Now with water flow  in the copper coil only

	Connect a loop of wire in a complete circuit with an ammeter.

	Move the copper wire coil close to the water carrying helix
	copper at close range.

	No magnetism but electrical current is produced in the ammeter
	circuit.

	He also seems to  suggest that we need high speed flow pumps and
	directional flow coils to improve the design.

	Maybe the two designs in this article could be linked to create
	the above flow pumps.

	Wind coil mentioned in this second article like normal dc coils
	are wound. Start at one end and tightly wind down in spiral path
	until one layer is finished  and in one rotation back to the top
	then back down again as at the start.

	Editor's note

	If what the professor suggests is correct, think of what kind of
	new motors and generators could be made, perhaps better
	performing than those we have now.
