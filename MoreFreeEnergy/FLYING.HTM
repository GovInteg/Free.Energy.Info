	What is described is a means of propulsion for such a flying
	disk.

	The entire  outer skin of craft is covered with means of
	producing Cathode ionizing rays.

	When an ionizing  ray is produces it breaks down a layer of air
	to form  a vacuum and then is re absorbed into the air.

	This could be a means of propelling a craft through the air.

	The reports of these craft seem to indicate they prefer flying
	in a straight  line for any given direction

	This could be achieved by the following means.

	For directional control the vehicles skin is divided into
	sixteen sections eight above on top and eight below.

	Please note more less sections could be used in the guidance of
	 the flying vehicle.

	To move the craft in any direction half of these sections must
	be switched to on and producing ionizing rays and the others to
	off leaving this area to a be normal air pressure.

	To move in any direction set the vacuum producing sections so
	that mid section top and bottom is in the direction you wish to
	go.

	The air in front of  craft for this direction is then turned
	into a vacuum and the normal air pressure behind craft pushes it
	into the low pressure area and because the ionizing  rays
	continues the craft continues to move in forward direction.

	To go up the entire top  surface  is turned to vacuum producing
	rays and the  bottom is turn  off.The craft entire craft moves
	upwards.

	To go down reverse the above process.

	To power the craft an ionizing  cathode ray generator could be
	employed as described in  the ION CATHODE GENERATOR

	This vehicle could not have portholes as the changing air
	pressures could cause them  to break so TV cameras would needed
	to be mounted around the edge  of craft to aid in navigation.

	The Ionizing field would produce a very bright light and would
	be very dangerous to anyone standing  near when in operation and
	could only be safely approached, when all of cathode emitting
	units were turned to  off.

	The fields would not effect the crew as the rays are projected
	outwards  and the radiation danger would probably be less than
	the normal environment.

	Those claiming to have seen a UFO  have often reported bright
	lights and some have had strange radiation burns on their bodies
	giving witness to their stories.

	Pressure Experiments.

	The following experiments are included to show to you the power
	of a vacuum and air pressure that surrounds us.

	Glass  Tumbler

	PLace some water in a glass tumbler   ,surprisingly it does not
	need to full as some suggest.

	Place a piece of cardboard or playing card over the top of glass
	and with   a hand holding card in place.

	Tip card and glass tumbler  over quickly and remove you hand and
	the air pressure from the  outside   and the vacuum inside will
	hold the card and water in place  without pouring onto the
	ground if done properly.

	Egg in Milk Bottle

	If you can get a milk bottle you can perform this experiment.
	 and a not too big fresh egg and piece of paper and a lighter.

	Put a slight splash of water around the top of the milk bottle
	to allow  slight lubrication.  Light   a piece of paper and drop
	into milk bottle wait until the paper has nearly burn out and
	place egg on the neck of the bottle.

	When the air inside of bottle has cooled it creates a slight
	vacuum in milk bottle and the outside pressure forces the egg
	inside bottle.

	If you soak the egg  in vinegar it will remove the outer shell
	and may make it easier to perform the experiment.

	Now that you have got the egg in the bottle how do you get it
	out?

	The only way I have seen is to put the bottle in your mouth and
	with lips around entire bottle give a strong blow and then put
	the egg into inside of neck of bottle.  Keep blowing until egg
	starts to move through neck to outside.

	There is another way however
	pour hot water into the bottle
	pour the egg into the neck
	and wait for the air inside the bottle to heat up
	and wait for the air pressure to build up and push the egg
	out.

	You could probably do  the above experiment like this with a small
	blown up balloon and a glass jar.  The balloon would certainly be
	easier  to remove  than the egg.

               This I have seen this happen  by accident.

	A hot coffee cup that has just been finished with and still hot
	is turned upside down on plastic place mat.  What happens when
	the coffee cup cools there is a partial vacuum created inside
	the cup  and the  place mat is drawn into the cup and a seal is
	formed around the lip of the cup.  When the cup is picked up
	later the place mat goes with it too.

	Electrokinetic Apparatus Invented by T.T. Brown Filed July 3
	1957 number 2,949,550

	This device consisted of two disk shaped devices mounted on a
	freely revolving platform which carries two high voltage charges
	one positive and one  negative supplied by a high voltage
	source.

	The disks themselves are made of a dialectic  centre, upon which
	are placed two conductors on the rims,  one being made positive
	and  the other one being made negative.

	Both saucers have electrical connections the same,  that is both
	of the back conductors on each disk are positive and  the front
	conductors are negative.

	The two conductors on any single disk  should be far enough
	apart to prevent  voltage sparking  crossover between the two
	conductors on  the said disk.

	Upon applying the high voltage to both disks the apparatus began
	to revolve  around the centre post  gradually gathering speed.
