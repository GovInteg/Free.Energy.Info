	Put an egg in a glass and watch it sink. How can you get it to
	come to the top without touching it?

	Answer

	Easy if you know how

	By adding salt to the water  and waiting for it to dissolve will
	make the egg rise.

	The surrounding area around the  egg has changed and the gravity
	effect has been altered.

	Maybe by the addition of sound waves to an area sounding an
	object and to the object  the effects of gravity can be changed
	also time will tell.

	THE PAST

	Lifting heavy weights has always been difficult.  But if the
	following story is true, there may have been in the distant past
	an easier way

	This is story that has been passed to me and I have two versions
	two different Locations but the details seem to be similar.

	It seems  an Oxford MD had a Tibetan student friend who invited
	him to Tibet and whilst there he witnessed the following

	He was taken to a monastery where a building operation was
	underway. At the scene  he noticed that at 250 metres above
	ground level there was a  cliff with a cave.

	He saw monks were busily building a wall on a small  area  in
	front of  the said  cave.

	At ground Level there laid  a smooth flat stone with a large
	indentation in it  one meter across by 15 centimeters deep.

	A block of stone about 1 by 1.5 meters was placed into this area

	At a distance of 63 metres from the container 19 musical
	instruments including (ragdonds)   were placed  together in a 90
	degree arc.

	* I believe ragdongs are long wind blown pipes that produce a
	  low frequency tone   *.

	All Distances had been carefully measured.

	The instruments consisted of 13 drums and 6 trumpets,

	Eight of the drums were 1 meter wide and 1.5 meters long.

	Four were medium sized 0.7 by 1 metre

	There was also  a small one 0.2 by 0.3m

	The drums were made from 3mm thick sheet metal and weight 150kg
	with one  end open.

	The operators stood behind their instruments when playing them.

	The small drum was used  to signal  a control to start.

	This resulted in the monks singing a mantra and the instruments
	making a loud low droning noise and drum noise.

	It seems for about four minutes nothing happened.

	When the tempo was increased the stone began to sway and then
	levitated  towards the cave opening

	Three minutes later it landed   on the platform at the cave
	opening.

	In one hour  so the story goes they  lifted 5 to 6 stones into
	position.  For this story to be true the  stones would have
	needed to have flown in a 500m long parabolic curve and a height
	of 250 metres.

	The drums and trumpets were  placed in an equal order and each
	trumpet was separated by drums.

	THE PRESENT

	Just before World War 2 a man in Florida built his dream home. A
	coral castle for him and his future wife in Europe.

	Unfortunately this arrangement was to her dislike and the
	marriage never occurred.

	All That Remains today is a tourist attraction called  Coral
	Keys with several unanswered questions.

	In that castle  are building blocks that large modern cranes
	have difficulty in lifting even today.

	Yet he used  a small wheel barrow and a loan of a pickup
	vehicle

	He never disclosed his secret, although some have suggested he
	used electromagnetic means.

	 In research establishments today experiments have conducted
	using sound waves produced electronically  to lift  small rocks
	and  little foam balls.

	The device consists of a speaker mounted  at the base and a
	reflector at top   to create sound wells in which the balls
	floated.  see middle illustration.

	THE FUTURE

	We may see sound playing a more important role in our lives as
	once the laser beam was an invention waiting for use in the
	early sixties to widespread use today it enjoys.

	We may yet see sound used in demolition and construction  work.

	Researchers need to find a way  to produce  a low frequency tone
	at high power levels to be able to lift heavy loads.

	In lifting this weight you must be able to direct where it will
	go.

	My idea is  to construct three units using high air compression
	with pipes cut to a fundamental frequency  as the actual
	frequency may result in pipes of extreme length.

	By having three beams  allows one to create a shifting sound
	well in which the load could sit and moved in a 360 degree
	circle at any given height depending on unit placement.

	Unfortunately the right frequency has yet to be found.

	An interesting experiment

	When factories were being built in Sydney Australia
	There was an unusual occurrence that used to happen every after noon
	between one o'clock and three o'clock every day for all the
	factories.

	A load droning sound would emit from all these factories  and
	of course this use to cause some headaches and some amusement.

	After much searching it was found that the gutter down pipes would
	become heated during the morning when exposed to the sun and would
	then be subjected to cooling air.

	This caused air eddy currents within the  pipes which would then
	cause  the pipes  to  resonate.

	The solution was found to be in detuning the pipes.

	You can get the same effect by getting a metre or there about of a
	length of metal tubing  place some wire mesh about quarter the way
	from the bottom inside  the tube .

	Now heat the bottom of the  metal tube until it has warmed up,
	about five minutes on a propane gas should be about right.
	( a candle could probably be used as well )

	Now by holding it upright  expose tubing to  normal air temperature
	and a load  droning sound will be heard.
