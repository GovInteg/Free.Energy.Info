	Air Bladder Water Pump
<P><P> <IMG SRC ="colorbar.gif" ALT=" color line  "><P>


	Another simple device based on the premise that no two objects
	can occupy the same space.  As you can see from the illustration
	the parts consist of a pvc pipe any length any diameter.  A
	rubber bladder that when inflated exceeds the inner diameter of
	the pvc piping.  This is more than you will need, but this gives
	a good margin to play with.  A top cap that will hold bladder in
	place and holds the T bar air supply.
<P>
               A simple valve in bottom
	of pvc piping, this need not be anything special.
<P>
	A simple one could be  a light piece of rubber cut in a circular
	shape and placed over  an end cap with a  reasonable size hole
	drilled in it.It could also be connected to bottom of badder and
	bottom of the end cap tubing, with a hinge so that it could be
	operated when the bladder expands and contracts.
<P>
	A water outlet on the side of the PVC tubing and a reliable air
	pressure source.  An air pipe of tubing made in a T shape  this will
	be the  means the air is supplied to rubber bladder.
<P>

	The pipe section of tubing entering bladder would need to be of
	a smaller diameter that the rest .  At the opposite end to air
	inlet a  means would be needed to open and close air pressure
	supply.
<P>
	This could be a simple rotary valve or electrical device
	operating by the unit  itself.  A much  simpler solution could
	just be an air tap operated by hand when water is needed.

	Experimental Version
<P>
	A experimental version could be made by using a smaller diameter
	Pvc tubing a t piece  inserted in middle to make an outlet and a
	bicycle tube.  A bottom valve made as described previously.
<P>
	Place the complete bicycle tube bent in half in the pvc piping so that
	air valve is at the top.  Place  the pipe pump in a water source
	 and then using a bicycle hand pump inflate tube.  You will need
	to find a way to deflate the tube.  This will not need to be a
	problem if you use a continuous source of air and the t bar air
	inlet as previously described.  If you are using a  continuous
	source of air pressure such as an air compressor remove the
	rubber in valve stem of inner tube so that air can flow in both
	directions without hinderance.
<P>
	Theory of Operation
<P>
	Air at beginning is directed into rubber bladder by turning the
	air outlet tap to off position.  The increasing pressure of
	bladder causes the bottom valve to be forced shut.  The bladder
	continues to inflate and water is forced up the pipe until it
	exits out the outlet.  When all water is expired.  The air
	outlet tap is opened so that air escapes and pressure in bladder
	is decreased and the Bernouli effect takes place to cause the
	badder to be compress.  This causes the bottom valve to be
	opened allowing more water to enter tube. The compressing of the
	bladder may also assist in drawing water into the piping if the
	water outlet is not too large or has a non return valve in it [
	although it is not necessary to this design.]
<P>
	I believe this device should work to any depth if air pressure
	can be maintained greater than water pressure  depth.
