	Today water is super heated to 1000 degrees under high pressure
	to generate our electricity.  What happens if we used something
	with a much lower boiling point.

	Some thing that boils at below 40 degrees f below  zero degrees
	perhaps  not many places can get that low, meaning we have a
	 reliable heat source.

	As strange as it seems this has been accomplished by man named
	Dennis Lee and a talented team from the United States.

	This man has been blocked in several ways one way was to send
	him to trial  for fraud this apparently had some TV coverage
	,a charge he claims he beat  it by the way.

	Remember these devices have been built and tested and
	unfortunately confiscated by authorities and never returned.

	This article is reproduced from the package Dennis Lee provides
	as an information package.

	Just think we could  have no more oil wars or oil pollution.

	His address is in the inventors section.

	His package contains three NTSC standard videos and a book and
	if not satisfied  he will refund your money.

	Apparently only two people have requested this to be done and I
	was not one of them.

	His book contained no copyright warning  so this extract is
	reproduced from his book to inform others that may not heard of
	him and in so give you the chance to be of assistance to him and
	to see what he is capable of.

	By the way I have no connection with this man and have nothing
	to gain from him

	Free Energy from Air a Layman's explanation.

	Lets see how this technology meets the criteria for
	practicality.

	What we are calling  practical is a unit that takes energy from
	the air 24 hours per day or night. 365 days and nights a year.
	To produce up to 50,000 kilowatts of free electricity per year
	at the retail cost of about $12,000  including a hot box thermal
	storage system for backup power.  In addition to producing free
	electricity it does it harmlessly with no pollution,toxic waste
	or damage to the environment.

	The first thing you need to know about a heat pump works "is the
	first law of thermal dynamics". It says that a hotter substance
	will give its heat to a cooler substance until the two equalize
	in temperature.  A heat pump uses a very cold liquid like freon
	and exposes it to the environment in flat plate collectors.

	These liquids are so cold they boil at 40 degrees F below zero.
	This means that because of the first law of thermal
	dynamics,anything in the environment that touches this liquid in
	those flat plate collectors, is going to give up it heat to that
	liquid.

	Is there anything in the environment that you can think of that
	is colder than 40 degrees f below zero? Sun? Rain? Wind? It may
	get pretty cold,but even the snow has heat to give up to the
	refrigerant.

	 If snow is 32 degree F above zero and the refrigerant boils at
	40 degree f below  that means there is 72 degree worth of heat
	that can be removed from the snow. There is a limitless supply
	of molecules outside warm enough to continually boil the
	refrigerant.  So just by exposing  refrigerant to the air
	through evaporative plates ,we can cause the refrigerant to boil
	any time.  The second thing you need to know is that when a
	 substance phase changes or chances state from liquid to gas for
	 instance ... it Absorbs a tremendous amount of energy.It
	 becomes a sponge for energy. For instant it requires  a lot of
	 energy to boil water from ground temperature which is about 55
	 degree f to 212 degree F. But believe it or not  it takes six
	 times as much energy to get it one more degree over the boiling
	 point than it took to increase it  that 150 f. So changing
	 liquids to gases absorbs a tremendous amount of energy.

	 While the refrigerant is absorbing a tremendous amount of
	 energy and the molecules are going crazy because it is boiling,
	 the temperature doesn't rise  much and the gas is not yet hot.

	 That is because the gas in a vacuum,expanding through a  huge
	 flat plate collector without any pressure.  Compressing that
	 energy into a smaller would increase the pressure make it
	 hot,and change it's boiling point.

	 Then we could transfer the heat and use it to provide energy
	 for us.  A compressor now becomes the key . All this gas
	 running freely through the evaporators is directed down into a
	 compressor where a piston in the compressor draws like a
	 syringe and fills up with energized gas.

	 Then all the gas in the full length of the piston chamber is
	 squeezed into a very small area causing each molecule to be
	 squeezed tightly together and thereby increasing the
	 temperature of the gas.  The gas comes into the piston chamber
	 at maybe 50 degree f and comes out after being compressed at
	 250 degree f.

	 The process lets the environment energize and expand the gas
	 and then uses a compressor to make it 250 degree hot.  The
	 compressor  does not put the heat into the gas ,it merely
	 squeezes it out,like squeezing a sopping wet sponge.250 degree
	 F gas is now hot enough to use to heat water or air and
	 actually transfer the heat produced.

	 Now how is electricity made? Your electric supplier uses water
	 which boils at 212 degree f and heats it up to 1,000 degree F
	 or more in a pressurized boiler gas(steam).The pressure is
	 released as the steam escapes past a turbine blade.  If we were
	 to take our 250 degree f hot gas coming out of our compressor
	 we could use it to boil another low temperature substance which
	 would become gas and turn blades that rotate a shaft.just like
	 the electric company.

	   But instead of heating up  water that boils at 212 degree f
	  in a pressurized vessel,why not use our hot gas to excite a
	  substance that typically boils at 40 degrees f below zero.
	  Now that 250 degree f gas would get that second fluid pretty
	  excited.  This would build up a lot pressure on our gas and
	  when escaped through turbine blades[ or air motor ] would
	  rotate a shaft that would power a generator to produce
	  electricity.

	  The difference between what we are doing to make electricity
	  and what the electricity company is doing, is that we are
	  doing it at much lower temperatures  and of course we are
	  doing it with energy from the air whereas they are burning
	  coal or oil to heat that water to 1000 degree F.  Their
	  process of burning  things to obtain high temperatures
	  pollutes the environment whilst this process we call low
	  temperature phase change burns nothing and provides safe
	  ,clean cost free energy

	The massive flat plate evaporater measures 8 foot by 3 foot Two
	thin sheets of aluminum  are silk screened with a vein pattern
	and heated and pressed together under 200 tons of pressure and
	they bond together as one piece except in the places where the
	dye of the silk screen made the vein pattern.  The veins
	actually poke out as the oxygen from the metal is pressed out of
	the aluminum.  The result is a 8' by 3' flat collector with a
	network of veins to put freon into and let boil through the
	other side.  A surface area of 400 square feet can be mounted in
	a 7 foot diameter.
