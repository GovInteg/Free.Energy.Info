	Paul Brown Variable reluctance generator.

	American Inventor
	Patent number and address unknown

	If any one can help let me know so he can get the credit
	He deserves.

	I believe he has built several units  but not sure how
	successful they were.

	The normal way  to generate electrical current is to pass a a
	conductive wire through a magnetic field.

	In this unit there is no need to move a heavy   coil of wire
	 and metal armature thus removing some of  the power  loss.

	In this application  two  permanent magnets or electro magnets
	are placed  opposite each other at 180 degrees.

	At ninty degrees to the magnets are mounted two field pick up
	coils.

	In the centre is a disk that has two metal magnetic influenced
	outer sections and a non magnetic influenced centre section.

	The  disk is rotated at speed and  when the metal sections  are
	in a position to provide a magnetic  pathway from the permanent
	magnets to the field pickup coils and back again  this will
	result in a electric current being induced in the coils.

	By  having the disk magnetic metal sections cutting in and out
	of the magnetic pathway  will give an  A.C. current/voltage
	output. Slightly changing the wiring setup could also give you a
	pulsating D.C. output.

	The  two disks could be made by using a fibre glass mould to
	give a disk shape and allowing the outer sections not to be
	filled and when mould has been set, put compacted metal filings
	in these sections and then given a final layer of fibre glass
	to seal metal section.

	If you have a metal workshop you may be able to make better
	disks  by using an aluminium core and magnetic outer metal
	pieces and use allen bolts to hold it together.

	The unit should be built  with laminated steel pole pieces to
	prevent magnetic strength losses and  where there is a reversal
	of the  magnetic force.  There is also a need for small air gaps
	,the best insulated wire and sufficient  length for the correct
	magnetic strength.  You will need to construct it on a non
	magnetic frame to prevent magnetic losses.

	Also select a suitable prime mover to drive the unit.  Whether a
	D.C. motor, Hydro Wheel or windmill.

	Using this setup means no relative motion between coils and the
	magnetic field  and the disk will accelerate  into the permanent
	magnet poles and slows down on the way out and therefore should
	result in a steady speed.

	The voltage is directly related to the change rate of the
	magnetic field and speed of the rotor.

	Amperage is related to how long the pole faces are in position
	with each other.
