<H1>The Edwin Gray Pulsed Capacitor Discharge Electric Engine</center>
</H1>

<P>
 <CENTER> <IMG SRC ="gray.gif" ALT="Gray diagram chart "><A\></CENTER>

<P>
In the early seventies there was constructed an interesting electric
motor using energy in storage capacitors to fire across spark
gap and to provide  power to electromagnets in a repulsion mode

<H2>Information from the patent abstract</H2>

<P>
This is disclosed herein an electric machine or engine in which
a rotor cage having an array of electromagnets is rotatable in
an array of electromagnets as fixed electromagnets are juxtaposed
against moveable move able ones
<P>
The coils of the electromagnets are connected in the discharge
path of capacitor charged to relatively high voltage and discharged
through electromagnetic coils when selected rotor and stator elements
are in alignment, or when the fixed electromagnets and movable
electromagnets are juxtaposed.
<P>
The discharge occurs across spark gaps disclosed in alignment
with respect to the desired juxtaposition of the selected moveable
and stationary electromagnets.
<P>
The capacitor discharges  occur simultaneously through juxtaposed
stationary moveable electromagnets wound so there respective cores
are in magnetic repulsion polarity, thus resulting in the forced
motion of moveable electromagnetic elements away from the juxtaposed
stationary electromagnetic elements at the discharge ,thereby
achieving motion.
<P>
In an engine the discharges  occur successively across selected
ones of the gaps to maintain continuous rotation ,Capacitors are
recharged between successive alignment positions of particular
rotor and stator electromagnets of the engine.

<H2>Background of the invention</H2>

<P>
There is no know engine or motor operated on the principle of
the present invention, that a capacitor charged to relatively
high voltage from a low voltage dc source is discharged across
a spark gap to provide current through motor driven coils in the
discharge path., these being solenoids which generate motion by
magnetic repulsion of juxtaposed pairs of coils.
<P>
The solenoids are preferably configured in motor and stator assemblies
to effect motion of the rotor elements with respect to the rotor.
<P>
The present invention utilises this principle to provide a rotary
motion machine or engine which can develop considerable torque
through the magnetic repulsion of rotor and stator cores wound
with coils through which capacitors are discharged synchronously
with the positioning  of rotor coils opposite particular stator
coils.
<P>
Similarly a linear action can be achieved with a stationary electromagnet
juxtaposed against a movable electromagnet and the moveable electromagnet
can perform work with a tool or piston attached thereto.
<P>
A novel control mechanism in associated with the rotor is the
engine to position discharge elements appropriately to create
the desired discharge through the electromagnetic when the juxtaposed
rotor and stationary electromagnets are in alignment.
<P>
The electromagnets in the stator and rotor are so arranged that
the control mechanism can advance or retard the discharge points
relative to rotor-stator positions for control of rotational speed.
<P>
The discharge overshoot or back emf from the collapsing fields
in the capacitor discharge is used to engerize external batteries
for construction of power.
<P>
The recovered energy thus stored may be used to operate equipment
associated with the engine or motive force producing device.
<P>
The engine or rotary electric machine of the invention is believed
to operate on the principle of conservation of energy, in that
once rotation is achieved ,current is needed only at the instant
of a capacitor discharge in order to advance the rotor.
<P>
The rotor moves to the next discharge point on the inertia of
the repulsion action.
<P>
The capacitor is recharged during the interval and stores energy
until discharge at the next rotor stator coil coincidence.Thus,
the new engine produces torque and stores the excess energy for
subsequence use.
<P>
In the linear motion device according to the invention only a
single pulse discharge is needed to perform work
<P>
The applications of the engine include use as an electric automotive
engine which is economical and which can regenerate a part of
the energy consumed to provide power to other loads in the automotive
vehicle. As a linear actuator an economical use of power is possible
because each stroke will result from a single discharge pulse
of a capacitor through a coil..
