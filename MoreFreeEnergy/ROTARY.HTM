	invented   by Eugene Frenette
<P>
	Several of these units have been built.  There are several ways
	to build a simple model,with the rotor and the  static parts
	having the same configuration.  They may be a  cone , cylinder
	or normal cup shape as in a tin cans.
<P>
	  It is recommended that
	the experimenter  start with two tin cans.  The tin cans should
	fit one in to the other with about 1/8  inch clearance around
	the sides and 1/4 inch   clearance between the bottoms of the
	two cans..  High temperature oil is put between the two tin
	containers   ,don't  overfill with the oil.
<P>
	One small unit produced about 110 degrees  Fahrenheit  in 60
	degree room.  the outer diameter of the vessel was no more than
	four inches.
<P>
	Another unit 30  inch  in diameter    and using  a 1/2 to 3/4
	horse power  at slow revolution The temperature  could easily
	have risen   to  between  200  and  300 degrees Fahrenheit.  The
	device heated 16 rooms for about  $30.00 a month.  The liquid
	molecules are set into greater motion due to the rolling
	friction between the stationary and rotating cups.
<P>
	A good conductor such as steel should be used to conduct the
	heat.  If you can get the liquid at  the right thermal vibration
	the heating action will be intensified.  Keep the design simple
	and operate at very slow speed.
<P>
       Further improvement would be to have both vessel rotating in
       opposite directions
