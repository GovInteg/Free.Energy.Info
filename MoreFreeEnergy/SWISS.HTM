The Swiss M/l Converter 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<IMG SRC ="colorbar.gif" ALT=" color line  "> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
This machine exists today in a commune near Bern Switzerland and
could have the answers to our energy needs.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The Unit is started by hand by revolving the two disks in opposite
directions and continues to move without further input.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
This device has only two moving parts namely the bearing races
at the centre of the disk.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The disk are made of acyclic plastic upon which are placed flat
a series of fifty blade type steel or aluminium sections equally
spaced around the middle sections of each disk.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The speed of the revolving disks is about 50 to 60 rpm limited
to this by magnetic impulses from the magnetic section on the
rim.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
To those that have seen this powerhouse in operation it is certain
that useable power is being extracted from the environment and
some is being used to run the machine.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
This is an energy system which relies on the self moving wimhurst
electro static generator for the high voltage and somehow the
members of this commune have found a way to extract ,amplify and
convert this energy to powerful useful levels.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The Swiss M/l converter is based on a modified wimhurst electrostatic
machine.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
My people have seen the swiss m/l converter in operation but to
do date no one has been able to understand
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
or successfully reproduced the results as claim by the Swiss commune
group Methernith in Linden .
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
But to one fortunate individual had a visit to Paul B.who is claimed
to have had said that if they could understand the above following
experiment they would be close to understanding how the device
was able to work.(as illustrated above)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
It consists of two plates of metal one aluminium the other copper
separated by a insulator of some unknown
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
material could be paper or plastic(unknown)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
It also included a horse shoe magnet wrapped with a coil of wire
and both ends soldered together.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Paul B placed this capacitor made of the differing metals between
the poles of a horse shoe magnet and
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
then asked a witnesses to connect the plates to two probes of
a voltmeter to each plate and to their surprise
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
found a voltage of seven hundred volts which occasionally dropped
in value..
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I have communicated with some people how have performed the above
experiment with little result however.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
WHAT I THINK HAPPENED ALTHOUGH I DON'T KNOW FOR SURE
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
PB may have conditioned the insulator of perspex of other similiar
insulator by the following means without
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
        revealing what he had had done.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
       It is known that if you heat perspex until  soft to touch
and becomes tacky and you then subject the heated mass to
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
      a high voltage field  via means of metal plates on each
side of perspex mass and leave it there until the perspex is
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
      cool .Removing the applied  high voltage charge
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
      an  electrostatic high voltage charge may  still be continously
taken from those metal plates 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
       something like this also  happens  with the electrostatic
microphones in modern tape recorders..
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
What part the magnet and the coil and differing face  metal plates
 plays in additional to the electrostatic charge is yet to be
determined by yours truly.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Looking at other parts of the machine the pickup fields that don't
touch the spinning disks are also made up
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
of perforated Aluminium separated with a perspex insulated and
 withcopper behind it.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I would like to know if any one has performed the above experiment
and got a successful result.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
BASED OF THE WIMHURST MACHINE
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The theory of operation of a wimhurst machine is. The disks are
of plastic, glass, hard rubber or in one case I saw old phonograph
records.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The contra rotating disk causes air molecules to become electrically
activated by the fictional movement of the air both disks causes.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
This rotating action causes the disks to become continually charged
and an electrostatic charge builds up, causing a flash over.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
To stop this flash over, a series of foil sections are attached
to the centre portion of each disk and equally spaced and back
to back with foil sections on the outer sides.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
To remove the charge, collection arms are arranged to collect
the charge and transfers the charge to a storage capacitor. At
45 degrees to these collection points is a neutralising bar that
extends to full length of the disk and has brushes at both ends.
A neutralising brush equals the charges on the metal foil position
at both positions on both sides.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The neutralising bar on opposite side disk is at ninety degrees
to the one for the other side.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

WHATS IN THE BIG CAN
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<IMG SRC ="cans.gif" ALT=" what in the cans "><A\> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
For many the cans in front of the Testakica have proved to be
a bit of a mystery.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
From information I have obtained the general opinion is that the
above diagram is close to explaining what in the twin cans. It
seems to a combination of two copper cylinders interlaid with
two perforated alumina screens
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
In the middle are six or more doughnut magnets upon which are
wrapped coils some think they could be bifilar in nature.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Between each magnet there is an air gap made possible by the plastic
spacers between each of them.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
In the middle of the magnets there is a single spiral of copper
or aluminium metal.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
It is possible although not confirmed that there is a common ground
at the bottom of each can connecting all these elements.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Don't quote me on this but it reminds me of an automotive transformed
connected in reverse and shielded with copper and aluminium shielding.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I not sure what roles the magnets provide but tesla used a magnet
field in his designs to give a dc voltage output
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
like modern day rectifiers in some of his AC circuits.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The magnets may also work similiar to work carried out by Captain
Hans Coler.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<IMG SRC ="fe.gif" ALT=" swiss  Testakica photo "><A\> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Some facts know about this machine.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Constant Power output 230 volts at 13 amperes for a 3kw rating
pulsed DC
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Dimensions 110cm wide 45 cm deep 60cm high
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
43.23 wide 17.68 deep weight approximately 20kg/ or 44 lbs X23.58
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Self propulsion by way of the esf flow principle of motorised
brushes to revolve the twin disks.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
the machine is started by hand revolving the disk after this no
additional input power is required.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Once unit is functioning it is not able to be moved with the machine
coming to a stop.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The temperature in the area of the machine tends to become cooler.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
P.B. seems to be in the area next to or by the machine when first
started.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Additional Information
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
There also seem to be a four inch single disk version that gave
out 300 watts but I know only
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
a little of this machine at the moment.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<IMG SRC ="colorbar.gif" ALT=" color line  "> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
From the weird science on the other sites section you can downland
several small mpeg videos of the machine in operation. I have
a 25 minute video of the Swiss ML in operation in the Australian
Pal format.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<IMG SRC ="colorbar.gif" ALT=" color line  "> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I am continually searching for addition information about this
device and if there is anyone who has additional information on
it's construction and operation I would be most grateful as I
have already built a wimhurst machine ,I would now like to construct
a ML machine.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
If you have any information on this device and you send it to
me it will be kept confidential if you so wish.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I have some circuit diagrams and will put them on this page if
I can get them get scanned successfully.
