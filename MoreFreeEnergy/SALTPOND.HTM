	Those large areas of the planet covered by salt ponds may be yet
	be of some use after all.  Work today is being carried on in
	Israel where they have the best location for work of this kind,
	that being the Dead Sea where they have built a power station
	using heat stored in this sea .

	There are also other areas in the United States of America and
	even in Australia.  Areas In rural Australia which are being
	destroyed by a salt may yet be made useful for energy
	production.


	These Ponds to be useful must have three differing zones of salt
	concentration not easy to obtain  which work together to trap
	and store heat originating from the sun.  The surface zone the
	lightest in salinity allows the heat to travel down  but not
	upwards and also acts as buffer to the second zone. The second
	zone prevents heat from returning to the surface. The third zone
	with the greater concentration of salinity acts as thermal
	storage and readily absorbing the solar heat rays`.


	The weather pattern in the area has a great bearing on the
	effect of this heat storage pond  where evaporation  and wind
	patterns can completely destroy any heat storage capability


	The wind can cause the three zones  to mix therefore destroying
	the heat  thermal  storage  properties of the  pond.  Floating
	wind barriers have been introduced to reduce the ripple effect
	of the wind across many lake surfaces.

	Some solar ponds can have a temperature of 100 degree c in the
	lower zone, whilst having a considerable lower one on  the top
	zone..

	Brine is pumped from the pond at the correct level and passed
	through a heat exchanger and maybe a temperature phase  changer
	and is  put towards  a number  uses  from power generation to
	desalination plants.

	Water from the top of lake could be used in the process  for
	cooling as there is  a temperature    difference between the
	zones.

	Although a large surface is required for the collection of the
	solar energy ,I have noticed an effect when I was storing
	gherkins in large wooden barrels containing  salt water.

	When the gherkins were removed and the brine was left to stand
	after a period of time in the sun there was always  a   cold top
	layer and a warmer bottom layer whenever I inserted my hand to
	drain them.

	I am sure this idea using a large wooden barrel or insulated
	container bottom and sides  and connected to solar  panel  with
	water flowing to bottom layer could be used as a heat storage
	unit.  This could also be improved by having a glass top to
	direct sunlight into bottom layer .
