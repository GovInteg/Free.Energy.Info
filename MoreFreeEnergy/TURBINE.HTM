Viktor was a man that studied nature carefully to create inventions that did 
not go against Nature but to work with it to produce useful energy.
Although this is not one of Viktor ideas I got the idea from reading the book 
Living Energies.
<P>
Today reaserchers are trying to make windmills that will produce electricity  
and more of it by making bigger wind vanes.
Unfortunately the bigger they get the more damage they suffer when rotating 
and have  speed controls to prevent destruction..
<P>
Nature when it wants to produce large amounts of energy   gathers it from a 
large area and compresses it in to a small area  
,for example cyclones and tornadoes.
<P>
This is what my idea is based on . 
<P>
Wind is collected from any direction by means of stationairy  vanes  curved 
slightly  and reducing in size from  a large starting collection point  and 
directed to a small  area directing compressed air in a cyclonic motion  
towards a spinning  egg shaped turbine that turns a electrical  generator 
DC or AC..
<P>
The direction the vanes are curved will determine the direction of the turbine  
and will then allow wind flow  to be collected from any direction. 
The vanes need to curved so that air flow is directed towards the centre flow 
and not out through another wind input area.
<P>
The egg  shape was choosen because it has unusual properties and allows the 
fast  moving air  to gradually  slow down as it  approaches the bottom of the 
egg turbine  and so not cause any damage to equipment.
<P>
Please note the  stationairy collecting vanes can be any size the bigger the 
better but securely anchored to  prevent movement  by wind gusts.
<P>
The centre turbine must be free to rotate in any direction.
<P>
The blades on the turbine need only  to extend from the hub  a small distance but must  follow a spiral path from the top to the bottom of  central hub.

This idea could be used with the newer DC brushless generators to produce
really efficient operation and possibility with reduce wear.

<P>
IF you build one let me know how you get on.
